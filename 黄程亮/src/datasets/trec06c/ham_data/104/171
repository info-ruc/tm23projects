>Please note the following fund opportunity:
>
>Program:        Biobehavioral Methods to Improve Outcomes Research (PA-05-142)
>Agency:         National Institutes of Health (NIH)
>Deadline:       October 1, February 1, June 1 annually through September 
>2, 2008
>URL:                http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-05-142.html

>This initiative is designed to foster biobehavioral research and develop 
>innovative research designs, methods of measurement, and data analysis 
>techniques. Designs and methods that examine the impact of biologic and 
>behavioral variables on individuals' health outcomes and quality of life 
>are encouraged. Scientists are encouraged to increase the interface of 
>biobehavioral research and clinical practice in existing core and 
>exploratory centers and training programs by sharing findings and 
>designing collaborative research projects.
>
>Ideally, interdisciplinary researchers should overcome differences in 
>perspectives, incentives, and methods by going beyond usual collaborations 
>to engage others to solve problems creatively and efficiently.
>
>Suitable topics for research include, but are not limited to, the following:
>
># Development of collaborative studies to expand the understanding of 
>biobehavioral factors that influence disease prevention, improve health 
>outcomes, or increase quality of life in acute or chronic illnesses.
>
># Early identification of exacerbations of disease by documenting their 
>occurrence with biological markers and behavioral measures of the given 
>variables.
>
># Evaluate the effectiveness of biological markers and behavioral measures 
>to monitor specific manifestations of health status or progression of disease.
>
># Explore nanotechnology as a new paradigm for investigating 
>behavioral/biological interfaces, predicting and preventing diseases. 
>Nanotechnology may be cross-inked to other approaches to provide a 
>quantitative measurement of biological processes.
>
># Explore influences of pharmacogenetics on physiological and 
>psychological responses to therapeutic interventions.
>
># Test models or frameworks that integrate the complexities of biological 
>and behavioral variables.
>
># Encourage novel technologies, imaging probes, or instrumentation such as 
>assay flexibility, more sensitive noninvasive techniques, robotics and 
>supercomputing networks, to expand biobehavioral interventions and assessments.
>
># Identify biobehavioral approaches and measurement techniques for 
>conducting research among diverse patient populations.
>
># Explore designs and methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
>integrated biological and behavioral interventions.
>
># Applications of interest to NIGMS would focus upon bi-directional 
>interactions between biobehavioral factors and the physiological response 
>to physical injury including traumatic burn, or peri-operative injury. 
>Also encouraged are studies on the interactions between biobehavioral 
>factors and response to anesthesia and perioperative analgesia, projects 
>on disease processes occurring as common complications following injury or 
>surgical intervention that are found within intensive care units (such as 
>sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure), 
>and research related to wound healing and tissue repair following injury. 
>Research topics also include the impact of allostasis and allostatic load 
>on the physiological response to injury, as well as how the response to 
>injury and treatment interventions affects biobehavioral functioning.
>
># The National Cancer Institute would like to encourage methodological and 
>technological innovation among biobehavioral studies that use cancer as 
>the disease paradigm and seek to improve clinical outcome (e.g., quality 
>of life, symptom management, disease progression). Research using 
>innovative methods to study the interface between behavioral factors 
>(e.g., stress, affect, coping), tumor biology (e.g., angiogenesis, T-cell 
>regulation, inflammation, viral oncogenesis) and other biological 
>mechanisms (e.g., apoptosis, DNA repair), and cancer control are appropriate.
