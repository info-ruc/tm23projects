Dear Tanin Na Nakorn:

We're currently working on a report on interval statistics, or
statistics for data sets which contain intervals rather than only
point estimates.  Maybe that will be interesting to you.  I can
send you an early draft in a couple of days.  If you give me
your postal address, I'll put you on the distribution list as well.

Perhaps when you see the report, you can suggest what
statistics in particular you might be interested in.
