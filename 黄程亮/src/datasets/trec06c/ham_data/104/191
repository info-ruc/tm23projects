Cisco IOS IPv6 Vulnerability

   Original release date: July 29, 2005
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT


Systems Affected

     * Cisco IOS devices with IPv6 enabled

   For specific information, please see the Cisco Advisory.


Overview

   Cisco IOS IPv6 processing functionality contains a vulnerability that
   could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
   code or cause a denial of service.


I. Description

   Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability in the way IPv6 packets are
   processed. US-CERT has not confirmed further technical details.

   According to the Cisco Advisory, this vulnerability could be exploited
   by an attacker on the same IP subnet:

     Crafted packets from the local segment received on logical
     interfaces (that is, tunnels including 6to4 tunnels) as well as
     physical interfaces can trigger this vulnerability. Crafted packets
     can not traverse a 6to4 tunnel and attack a box across the tunnel.

     The crafted packet must be sent from a local network segment to
     trigger the attack. This vulnerability can not be exploited one or
     more hops from the IOS device. 

   US-CERT strongly recommends that sites running Cisco IOS devices
   review the Cisco Advisory and upgrade as appropriate. We are tracking
   this vulnerability as VU#930892.


II. Impact

   This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker on
   the same IP subnet to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
   service. The attacker may be able to take control of a vulnerable
   device.


III. Solutions

Upgrade

   Upgrade to a fixed version of IOS. Please see the Software Versions
   and Fixes section of the Cisco Advisory for details.

Disable IPv6

   From the Cisco Advisory:

     In networks where IPv6 is not needed, disabling IPv6 processing on
     an IOS device will eliminate exposure to this vulnerability. On a
     router which supports IPv6, this must be done by issuing the
     command "no ipv6 enable" and "no ipv6 address" on each interface.
