I guess it depends on what you mean by "radically different"
First, remember that this is my notebook at home which may not be
ideal for running DMDX.  However, we are observing the same problems
on desktops configured for DMDX on campus.

When I do "Basic Tests: Refresh rate" it returns either 16.64 or
16.66.  Currently 16.661 is saved in the registry from the last timing
test.

If I use 16.661 and press the Enh Retrace button in the Time Video
mode test, I see a blue box in center of screen with red on top and
bottom.  Its fairly stable with a little jumping up and down but no
systematic movement of the boxes in either direction.  If I use 16.641
and press the Enh Retrace button, the red and blue boxes slowly scroll
up the screen, suggesting this isnt the right setting?  Therefore we
have continued to use 16.661

If I select the Do Test button from Time Video mode, I get relatively
high timed out retraces (53%) and multiple misses (19%) but 0% certain
errors.

If I run the Tachistoscopic Acid test for 141 flips, I get 140 timed
out, 0 multipy timedout 0 certain errors, 0 last minute flips, 0 wait
for blit, the longest flip is 16.86 and the longest blit is 17.69.

Do any of these stats suggest the source of the error?  Its surprising
to me that it occurs on multiple computers also.
