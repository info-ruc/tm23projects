Dear colleagues,

Please find below the program of a Control Summer School that
will take place on 12-16 September 2005,
in Grenoble, France. This school is about the application of interval
analysis and constraint propagation to identification, control
and robotics. It is open to graduate students, researchers or engineers
who want to learn the concepts of interval computation,
to understand why constraint propagation is essential to deal with
problems involving many variables, and to find realistic applications
where interval methods are needed. The lessons will be in english. No 
prior
knowledge on control, robotics or interval analysis is required.

More information about this summer shool can be found at
http://ecole-ete-auto.lag.ensieg.inpg.fr/index_uk.html.

The deadline has actually been extended, so you should not hesitate to 
register even after the end of July.

We hope to see you in Grenoble,

Luc Jaulin and Eric Walter.
