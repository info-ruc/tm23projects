Dear Colleagues,

I am just now learning that the term "validation" is already in common usage 
with a different meaning that what is often used in our circle. I recommend 
NOT using it the way many of us have been using it. Instead, in order to 
conform to already established usage, it should be called "verification". If 
we compute enclosures of solutions, we can talk about enclosures, of course. 
Evidently "validation" is widely used to refer to agreement with physical 
effects, experimental results, etc.
 Please see remarks below by Ivo Babuska.

> Validation is also related to the experimental results. Notions as
