Dear Colleagues:
 
I agree with Ray and Ivo. In engineering circles and certainly within chemical engineering "validation" has to do with consistency with experimental data or observed physical phenomenon. The interval community would do well to adopt the universal meaning. Best regards. Luke

Dear Colleagues,

I am just now learning that the term "validation" is already in common usage
with a different meaning that what is often used in our circle. I recommend
NOT using it the way many of us have been using it. Instead, in order to
conform to already established usage, it should be called "verification". If
we compute enclosures of solutions, we can talk about enclosures, of course.
Evidently "validation" is widely used to refer to agreement with physical
effects, experimental results, etc.
 Please see remarks below by Ivo Babuska.
