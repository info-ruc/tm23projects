Dear Friends,
=20
I have just learned that Professor G. Randy Keller from the
Department of Geological Sciences of the University of Texas at El
Paso has been elected a Foreign Member of the Polish Academy of
Sciences.
=20
In his geophysical research, Professor Keller has used interval
techniques. His paper "Eliminating Duplicates
  Under Interval and Fuzzy Uncertainty: An Asymptotically
  Optimal Algorithm and Its Geospatial Applications"
appeared in Kluwer-published international journal
  Reliable Computing (2004, Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 401-422).
=20
He co-authored several interval-related papers in the conference
proceedings, including the proceedings of the 2004 NSF Conference
on Reliable Engineering Computing in Savannah, Georgia.
=20
Congratulations to Randy Keller!

Vladik
