Wayne,

Another possible source of confusion with the term "interval arithmetic"
is that people do "automatic result verification" or "rigorous
error bounding" using directed rounding but do not explicitly use interval
arithmetic.  That is, instead of having an interval data type, 
they may find it useful to carry out two sets of floating point
computations, programming each carefully and explicitly switching
the rounding mode where necessary to be assured of a lower bound
on the exact result for the first estimate, and an upper bound on
the exact result for the second estimate.  Some of the most prominent
application successes of automatic theorem proving with floating
point arithmetic were done this way.

Best regards,

Baker
