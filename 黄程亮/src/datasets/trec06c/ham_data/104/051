Georgia Alert 7-15-05:&nbsp; <BR>
PRESS RELEASE:&nbsp; Department of Agriculture Seeks Artwork License Plate<BR>
<BR>
ATLANTA - The Georgia Department of Agriculture invites Georgians to <BR>
participate in its Dog and Cat License Plate art contest.&nbsp; As part <BR>
of a funding initiative for the Dog and Cat Sterilization Program <BR>
(DCSP), the contest will determine a design for a new license plate <BR>
to benefit the Program.&nbsp; To submit designs, participants should <BR>
adhere to the following guidelines and rules:<BR>
<BR>
*&nbsp; Art must be no larger that 14&quot; tall and 11&quot; wide<BR>
<BR>
*&nbsp; Art must depict a dog and/or cat<BR>
<BR>
* Art use no more that four colors<BR>
<BR>
* Submit deigns to:<BR>
&nbsp; &quot;Dog and Cat Artwork&quot;<BR>
&nbsp; Georgia Department of Agriculture<BR>
&nbsp; 19 Martin Luther King, Jr. SW<BR>
&nbsp; Room 106<BR>
&nbsp; Atlanta GA&nbsp; 30334<BR>
<BR>
*&nbsp; All artwork becomes property of the Georgia Department of <BR>
Agriculture<BR>
<BR>
A panel of judges will determine the winning submission and award up <BR>
to $1,000.&nbsp; The winning art will be featured on the new Dog and Cat <BR>
License Plate, which will be sold in addition to the current design <BR>
beginning in December 2005. <BR>
 <BR>
The Dog and Cat License Plate currently is the primary funding <BR>
source for the Dog and Cat Sterilization Program (DCSP).&nbsp; The <BR>
innovative program provides subsidies for spay/mneuter procedures by <BR>
license and accredited veterinarians.<BR>
<BR>
Since this program receives no state monies, it depends on public <BR>
and private donations to perform its vital mission of curbing pet <BR>
overpopulation in Georgia.&nbsp; Unlike other spay/neuter programs, the <BR>
Dog and Cat Sterilization Program has no participation income <BR>
requirements.&nbsp; Any Georgia resident may benefit from the program.&nbsp; <BR>
Interested residents should contact their local veterinarians to <BR>
confirm program participation or call the Department at (404) 656-<BR>
3667. <BR>
 <BR>
Complete rules and regulations for both the artwork contest and the <BR>
Dog and Cat Sterilization program (DCSP) are available at <BR>
www.agr.state.ga.us.<BR>
<BR>
Georgians may support the Program now by purchasing a current Dog <BR>
and Cat License Plate for their vehicles.&nbsp; The commemorative license <BR>
plates are available at county tag offices throughout Georgia for a <BR>
$25.00 one-time fee.&nbsp; More than $22.00 from each license plate sold <BR>
directly benefits the DCSP.&nbsp; These funds are allocated only for <BR>
spay/neuter procedures and educational outreach on this healthy <BR>
choice.&nbsp; More than 45,000 Dog and Cat License Plates have been sold <BR>
since 2003, earning more that $1.1 million.&nbsp; Georgians may also <BR>
contribute to the DCSP in honor or memory of a loved one.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Contributions are 100% tax-deductible and provide much-needed <BR>
funding to promote spay/neuter statewide.<BR>
