Call for presentations/ participation:
       Small TYPES workshop
"Constructive analysis, types and exact real numbers."
       3/4 October 2005
     Nijmegen, the Netherlands
Deadline for registration:  September 1st 2005.

* Call for Papers: Special issue of Mathematical structures in computer 
science.
* Call for Participation: Many digits competition for exact real arithmetic

============================================================
The workshop will be held at the campus of the Radboud University Nijmegen
(formerly known as University of Nijmegen or Catholic University of
Nijmegen). This workshop is part of the TYPES project
(http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/Types/)

Topics include, but are not limited to:
    * the development of constructive analysis in type theory
    * program extraction from such developments
    * exact real number computation
    * co-inductive methods for continuous structures
    * semantics for real computations (e.g. domain theory, formal topology)

Invited speakers:
Martín Escardó and Norbert Müller

of MSCS. Submission is not limited to the participants of the workshop.
Schedule:
1 December  2005     Deadline for submission

==========================================================
The "many digits" friendly competition on exact real arithmetic will be held 
in conjunction with the above mentioned workshop. See
