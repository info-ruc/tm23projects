If it would have forced the powerful Sun to remove intervals from their
software, how much more will it force us to the same step now that
Sun has already done what you pictured only as a ficticious scenario.

Thus if Sun felt threatened by the prospect of someone possibly issue
patents, shouldn't we feel even more threatened by Sun actually having
issued patents??!

Scenario 3: Others have great ideas and publish them.
You file for patent protection...

This is what Sun did.

We are threatened not by commercial exploitation of our ideas,
nor by having patented their own ideas, but by having patented
the existing state of the art and thus threatening to force us
to pay for publicly long available ideas...

Sun is our threat. They now have (and are the only ones with)
legal power to put an end to the use of interval software outside
Sun's reach.

It would be foolish to communicate them to Sun.
They would patent them like they patented interval multiplication
and other things...

In view of Sun's policy it becomes wisdom to be secretive.
The scientific world of interval computations has become a
worse place because of them.
