Hi DMDX
	I am trying to setup DMDX so that when a User logs onto a machine its 
already setup.  I have been trying a few things and I think I'm close to 
having it worked out but I'm having some difficulties and would appreciate 
any pointers that anyone may have.

Its to be installed on a Windows XP Pro, SP2 machine.  DMDX works fine if 
installed and only used by one user.  I'm not sure it matters but the 
machine is joined to a domain.  I copy the registry settings, copy the 
desktop icons and open up access to the DMDX directory.

Thanks in advance
Peter
