DMDX and Jonathan,
         I have to publicly thank Jonathan for his help with this 
problem.  I now have a solution, I think it can be improved but it 
works.  The "Retrace Thread" problem was of my own making.  The default 
user settings I was using appear to have been the fault and I have modified 
them and they now work (if the user is in the Power Users group).

The settings I have for the current user are below.  If you save them as a 
.REG file and install them once the user has logged in you dont need to run 
TimeDX.  You can also install them as the Default User settings but I have 
had some problems with Win XP pro SP2 and suggest caution.  You do need to 
open up the permissions on the DMDX program files directory (users need write).

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

The problem appears to have been fixed by the line
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TimeDX\3\1\0 Primary Display 
Driver\800x600(600)_16bpp_0Hz]
@="13 16.876 600 16.576"
that was initially
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TimeDX\3\1\0 Primary Display 
Driver\800x600(600)_16bpp_0Hz]
@="-3 0.300 600 0.000"

-note the refresh time is now included.
