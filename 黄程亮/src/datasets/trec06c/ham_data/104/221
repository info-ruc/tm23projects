Indeed, that is what its means in that particular engineering 
community and that's the "informal meaning" in most discplines.  I'm 
not saying you're incorrect; all I'm saying is that the terms have a 
very broad meaning outside the very narrow and generally ill-defined 
usage in a particular engineering group. The work at the National 
Laboratories go way past your meanings; we can't just blow up a bunch 
of nukes to get new data.

See my paper on the Michelson-Morley experiment in ``The 
Michelson-Morley Experiment as a Case Study in Validation.'' 
Computers in Science and Engineering.  Nov-Dec, 2002. 40-51.
