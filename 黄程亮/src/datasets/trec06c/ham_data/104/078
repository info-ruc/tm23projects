   DMDX tries to access the HKLM tree of the registry for all keys, if it 
can't get the permissions it needs it then tries the HKLU branch.  There's 
one HKLM (the local machine) and there's a HKLU (local user) branch per 
user.  So by default you shouldn't have to do any tinkering with registry 
permissions as long as you're using a really recent version of DMDX (as I 
fixed some detail to do with this a short while ago).  Theoretically you 
should be able to set things up for the administrator and then the less 
privileged users won't be able to change those things if you don't give 
them permissions to run TimeDX but should be able to save settings on a per 
user basis.

   Only stuff in addition to the changes in the code for registry keys is 
that I've had to do is to give write permissions to everyone so DMDX can 
create it's intermediate files in / Program Files / DMDX.  Guess one day 
I'll change the code to try a different location for those if it fails to 
get write access too.
