   Yeah, the retrace thread gets killed at the end of the syntax check just 
like it would be killed at the end of a subject run.

   Sounds like something is going wrong and given the Retrace Threads lack 
of response it's reasonable to assume it's there.

   All good values.

   Other than the fact that key mappings stay active once made so there's 
no need for repeated <mpr> and <mnr> keywords that looks fine.

   Perhaps your video drivers are allergic to non-privileged user 
requests.  I take it EZ mode doesn't suffer from the sluggishness?  I'd be 
looking at new video drivers as DMDX has certainly been run in less 
privileged environments before and I sure can't think of anything to do 
with privilege level that would slow DMDX down.  Stop it working outright, 
yes, but slow, you're into the wild blue yonder there.
