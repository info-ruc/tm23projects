I have used a CIO/DIO 24 from Computerboards for triggering EEG with past versions of DMDX (although I have yet to do this in XP).  Parallel ports are not reliable for timings....so EPrime hasn't done you any favors by allowing you to trigger from the parallel port.  The CIO/DIO 24 is relatively inexpensive, and is much tighter with temporal precision.
