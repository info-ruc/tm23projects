Phuket Overview:

An island of contrasts, Phuket has much to offer its visitors. White =
sandy
beaches abound the west coast and mangrove lined shores, the east. A =
range
of hills runs down her back from north to south, dividing the island in
half. Waterfalls, especially in the 'wet' season spill into rock pools,
scattered down the slopes. In the distance, islands rear out of the
Andaman Sea, waiting to be explored. For more information, please visit:
