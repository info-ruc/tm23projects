Subject: New Book, Accuracy and Reliability in Scientific Computing

Numerical software is central to our computerized society. It is used
to design airplanes and bridges, to operate manufacturing lines, to
control power plants and refineries, to analyze future options for
financial markets, to determine genomes, to provide the understanding
necessary for the treatment for cancer. Because of the high stakes
involved, it is essential that the software be accurate, reliable, and
robust.

The IFIP Working Group on Numerical Software has produced a book
"Accuracy and Reliability in Scientific Computing" with the objective to
investigate some of the difficulties related to scientific computing,
such as accuracy requirements and rounding, and to explain how to obtain
accurate and reliable results. The book has authors both from the
working group and outside experts.

It was published by SIAM late July 2005 and further information is
available via http://ec-securehost.com/SIAM/SE18.html =
