You have permission to use a photo -- though I fear what photo it might be 
as I don't recall having one taken!  ;-P

Hello again, former purpleshirts!

I am now seeking your permission to archive your IT Lab staff photo in the
iSchool's digital repository, as a supplement to your archived tutorial
materials.  I believe this visual information lends a bit of humanity and
creativity to the
archive.

Please respond to this message stating whether you grant or decline 
permission
for your lab staff photo to be archived in this iSchool digital repository
project.

I will send email notification of the project's completion, as well as
information on how to access the archived materials, to all Lab staff 
(current
and former) whose materials are archived in this collection. 

Thanks for your time. 

I shan't bother you with permission requests again :)
