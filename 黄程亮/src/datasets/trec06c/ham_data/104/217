Good Morning,

Yes, the terms "verification" and "validation" (and "accreditation" 
or "certification") have a very distinct meaning to the US Department 
of Defense, Department of Energy, and NASA. AIAA and ASME also have 
or soon will have standards on this. It goes by the term V&V or VV&A 
depending on the sponsor.

You can get a quick overview of the area by going to www.dmso.mil and 
in the navigation bar on the left look for "VV&A." There have been 
two conferences Foundations 2002 and 2004; I was co-program chair of 
each.

My interest in reliable computing is directly the result of VV&A issues.

steve
