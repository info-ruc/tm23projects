Hello sir,

I need "interval distribution".

for example,

there are d intervals is the system. and i want to
know probability of there situations.

1) all of intervals are overlap.
2) there are k intervals overlap.
3) no intervals are overlap.
and more ... about overlapping.

Is there any formula or study about distribution of
interval data?

Please help me.

Thank you very much.

PS. I'm not good at English. Please forgive me for
miuse of English.
