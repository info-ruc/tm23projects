  <pre wrap="">Libby, 

I didn't get a response from you, and I know you are the cooperative type, so
I'm giving you another chance to reply ;)

Greetings, oh esteemed IT Lab tutorial author!

I&#8217;m currently working on a digital archives project for my graduate coursework
in the School of Information.  I would like to archive the tutorial materials
you created during your time here as IT Lab staff.  Myself, Dr. Pat Galloway,
and the Instructional Technology Services staff here consider these digital
learning objects to be valuable in both the short and long term, for a variety
of reasons, making them ideal materials for developing an institutional digital
repository.

In order to archive the tutorial materials you authored, which are currently
linked from the School of Information Tutorials Web page at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/technology/tutorials/browse.php">http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/technology/tutorials/browse.php</a>, I need to secure
your permission, or at least an indication of your intention to grant such
permission.  

Recently, the Instructional Technology Services staff developed a copyright
license agreement, which provides permission to use tutorial materials for
projects like mine.  Please read the copyright agreement text below, and reply
to this email stating your agreement or disagreement with the terms.

Alternatively, you may print out the attached copyright agreement document,
fill it out, sign it, and fax it to the iSchool at 471-3971, marked &#8220;attention:
Melanie Cofield, IT Lab.&#8221;  Yet another alternative is to choose a license from
those offered by Creative Commons at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/license">www.creativecommons.org/license</a>.  If you
choose this licensing option, and opt to allow me to archive your materials in
the iSchool's digital repository, please send me your license information via
email. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have.

Thanks for your time,

-Melanie
