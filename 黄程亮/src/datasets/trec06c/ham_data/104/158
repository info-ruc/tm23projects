PLEASE,
Permit me to inform you of my mind, Because I have make up 
my mind to write to you.however is not mandatory nor will 
I in any manner compel you to honour against your will. I 
am Miss Suzuena  Kone the only daugther of my late parents 
Mr and Mrs kONE. My late father was a highly reputable 
business merchant in a cocoa who operated in the capital 
of Ivory Coast during his days.
Unfortunately I lost him mysteriously died in France 
during one of his business trips abroad last year octomber 
2005. though his sudden death was linked or rather 
suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who 
travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth. 
My mother died when I was just 20 years old, and since 
then my late father took me so special. Before his death 
on Feb 9th/2006 he called the secretary who accompanied 
him in hospital and told him to call me, on my arrival to 
the hospital my father told me that he deposited the sum 
of 3.5 million US Dollars. (3.5 million dollar) left in 
suspense account in one of the leading bank here in 
Africa.
He further told me that he deposited the money in his 
name,and I as the next of kin and finally issued a written 
instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of 
all the necessary legal document to all his properties. I 
am just 20 years old and a University undergraduate and 
really don't know what to do. Now I want an account 
overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is because 
I have suffered a lot of set back as a result of family 
enemity and incessant political crisis here in Ivory 
coast.

Please, I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance 
in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly 
regarded. Now permit me to ask these few question:
1.Can you honestly help me as your new family?
2.Can I completely trust you?
3.what percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me through my
personal mailbox at:(suzuena@yahoo.ca)
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Suzuena Kone
