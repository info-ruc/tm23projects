Hi.

I'm new to DMDX, helping a researcher use it to set up an experiment.

The experiment structure is simple:

The subject hears a sentence (a 4-second .wav file) played twice with a 2-second
delay in between, and presses Left-Shift to indicate "NOT PROPER GRAMMAR"
or Right-Shift to indicate "PROPER GRAMMAR".  There is a 4-second timeout if
no response is given.

The researcher would like the subject to get feedback as to whether the response
was accepted (without indicating "correct" or "wrong") and different feedback
if a timeout occurred.

I tried to set this up -- see the script (abbreviated) below.  The subject
sees one of the two messages: "Response Recorded" or "NO  RESPONSE".

There are two problems:

1. The messages disappear too quickly from the monitor.

   Is there a way for me to force a 2-second display before moving to the next item?

2. The confirmation message "Response Recorded" actually becomes
   "Response Recorded nnnn.nn" with the Response Time displayed.

   Is there a way to suppress the inclusion of RT in the message?

Thanks for any suggestions.

Steve Albin
