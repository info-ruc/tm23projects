To Sandra Visan and Mailing list moderator(s),

I signed up for the mailing list of the Romanian Club as well as the
cultural institute for related information however I am constantly
bombarded with unrelated material and spam forwards.

(RO Club at CU please forward this to your members).

The thebreastcancersite.com site is NOT legitimate. It has very
little pertinent information about the disease and it's merely a
site that sells anything pink to make money. No one will donate a
free mammogram. If you look closely buying a $20 bracelet will get
you 1% donation to a mammogram.

the real site is http://www.breastcancer.org/

If you read about the owners of the fake site you'll see they own an
company "CharityMall.com, LLC, a cause-related shopping portal"
which obviously is not NON PROFIT.

If you want to really support finding a cure, donate to a hospital
or a walk for breast cancer instead of flooding our inboxes with
propaganda.

It's inappropriate and has nothing to do with the Romanian Cultural
Club.

Please tell ten friends today The Breast Cancer site is having
trouble getting
enough people to click
on it daily to meet their quota of donating at least one free
mammogram a day
to an
underprivileged woman .

It takes less than a minute to go to their site and click on
"donating a
mammogram" for free (pink
window in the middle). This doesn't cost you a thing. Their
corporate
sponsors/advertisers use the
number of daily visits to donate mammogram in exchange for
advertising.

Here's the web site! Pass it along to people you know.
