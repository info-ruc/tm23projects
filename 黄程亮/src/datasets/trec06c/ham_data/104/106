Dear Colleagues,
I am happy to inform you that I was awarded Ph.D degree for my thesis entitled "Analysis of Cable-stayed bridges by fuzzy finite element modelling" by Osmania university, Hyderabad, India.
I was immensly benfitted by the help received from the members of this mailing list. I received help from many researchers of the interval community from time to time via e-mail correspondence. 
In particular, I recieved a great deal of help from Prof. Rafi Muhanna and Dr Andrejz Pownuk. I am ever grateful to them.
