What's wrong with calling it "interval arithmetic"?  I presume that's
what we really mean when we refer to "reliable computing", "validated
computing", "verified computing", etc., on this list.  All of these
terms are too vague and prone to being mis-interpreted.  I believe
the only confusion that could arise when using the term "interval
arithmetic" is that some people do NON-validated computing with
intervals -- that is, keeping track of endpoints in a non-rigorous
way.  Since that's the only possible confusion I can forsee at
the moment, and it's a very subtle difference, I propose that if 
we choose a new term that we choose "validated interval arithmetic".

One could argue that we're doing more than just interval arithmetic
these days; for example is validated global optimization, or validated
ODE integration, just "interval arithmetic"?  Maybe it's more, but
there's less chance of confusion if you say "global optimization validated
with interval arithmetic", or "ODE integration validated with interval
arithmetic".  It's a bit long-winded, but much less prone to confusion.
