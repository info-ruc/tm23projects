Synopsis:
Elvis and Madona, the two characters of Romanian author
Saviana Stanescu’s ten-minute play Aurolac Blues, talk about
their lives in the streets of Bucharest, their nights in the
shelter, and their sneaking into movie screenings, while
passing back and forth a plastic bag with Aurolac (silver
paint). America is a constant in their conversation, and
Elvis tells his dream of becoming a vampire and fly to
America. Ultimately, Aurolac enables him in transforming his
body; but will he fly to his America? 

This short play captures in a few moments the widespread
diffusion of American pop culture while focusing on the
desolate lives of an eight and a nine year-old street kid,
who utter everyone’s somewhat naïve image of America. The
simple, straightforward dialogue provides room for
reflections about our expectations of life, and even though
Elvis’s transformation at the end is dramatic, strangely the
play remains nondramatic. No revelation or solution marks
this short play, but instead it gives a transient glimpse
into another person’s dream of America.
