   Hmm, it's a pretty slow machine that can't load a bitmap in half a 
second.  But you should be checking the preparation times regardless.

   Not all items will get displayed as errors, for instance I suspect 
instructions are free of any diagnostics for lateness.  So your D of 1 
might be catching the odd instruction, you've also got comments in there 
which will also be affected by the D of 1.  Try a D of two or three and see 
if the problem doesn't go away.
