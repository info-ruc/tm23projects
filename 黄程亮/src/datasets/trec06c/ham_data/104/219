This is true. The reason AIAA and ASME have gotten involved is that 
the terminology needs to be standardized. When I deal with 
scientists, there is always confusion because they can't conceive 
"verifying" something outside the "valid" range. Mathematicians use 
the words interchangeably while logicians have a strict distinction.

Verification by testing is still verification, for example. Computer 
scientists use the term to stress a link between code and 
specification; they even sometimes ask the validation question "Does 
this actually do what the customer needs?"

So, yes, the terms are not used uniformly but given the number of 
computational science and engineering organizations that use the 
terms in the way I do, it will become more common to make the 
distinctions I've made here.
