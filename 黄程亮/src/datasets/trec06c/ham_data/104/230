I've personally used "generalized interval arithmetic" as an umbrella 
term for affine arithmetic, Taylor models, and lower / upper bound 
computations for over ten years. Variants of each were used in 
graphing programs I implemented prior to writing my M.Sc. thesis. 
When I was finishing up the thesis, I became aware of Hansen's 
earlier "generalized interval arithmetic" but decided to stick with 
the name as I saw his earlier work as a precursor of the later 
arithmetics.

P.S. Regarding Sun's patents, one possible benefit is that the fear 
of lawsuits might (imperceptibly?) improve the decorum of interval 
forums. Interval aficionados that have been in violation of said 
patents for many years (indeed, many years before the patents were 
even applied for) would seem to have had plenty of time to apply for 
licenses. Should prudent researchers start setting aside some funds 
in their budgets for licensing (from future patent holders) the work 
that they're now doing?




Years ago, in grade school,
Teachers used to say,
"For every problem, there's a rule,
So do it just that way."
But when I got to college
They said I always must
Apply my basic knowledge,
Since rules are to distrust.
The New Math thought that every kid
Should give real thought a try.
It didn't matter what you did
Just so you told them why.
Then the computers came along,
And algorithms, too,
Constructed so you can't go wrong
No matter what you do.
