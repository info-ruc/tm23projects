   No.

   Might work.

   The original code used HKLM, nowadays with actual user privileges and 
HKLM becoming an administrative branch HKLU gets checked incase HKLM won't 
work.

   They could store timing information, it all depends on what was done by 
the privileged users.  Whatever they didn't do will be duplicated in HKLU 
for the non-privileged users.

    Interesting.  It's not something to be concerned about other than tests 
taking longer to finish in TimeDX and DMDX taking longer to terminate a 
job.  The code normally asks the Retrace Thread to politely die after it's 
no longer needed, if it doesn't do it after a second it kills the thread 
and posts the error you see.  It's one of those error messages that I never 
expect to see but it crops up from time to time and I've never been able to 
discern why it might occur.  It's not indicative of anything not working as 
near as I can tell.

   The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.
