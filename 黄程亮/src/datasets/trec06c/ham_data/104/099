                 LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
               Special Issue in honor of Paul Fuhrmann


Linear Algebra and its Applications is pleased to announce a special issue
in honor of Professor Paul Fuhrmann on the occasion of his 70th birthday
on 5 August 2007 in recognition of his many important and fundamental
contributions to linear algebra and control theory.

We solicit papers for the special issue within the entire scope 
of LAA or the research interests of Paul Fuhrmann. We welcome papers 
within system and control theory and operator theory; in particular in

   * algebraic systems theory
   * approximation, identification and interpolation
   * behavioral theory
   * coding theory with relations to systems theory
   * functional models
   * geometric control
   * hybrid and discrete event systems
   * matrix-valued and operator-valued functions
   * model reduction
   * multidimensional systems
   * numerical and computational aspects
   * operators, systems, and linear algebra
   * polynomial methods in systems theory
   * robust and optimal control
   * spectral factorizations
   * stability theory
   * system structure
   * uncertain systems
   * Wiener-Hopf factorizations


The deadline for submission of papers is 31 March 2006.  Papers for
submission should be sent to any of the five special editors, preferably
pdf files as attachments in email, and will be subject to normal
refereeing procedures according to LAA standards:
