   Doesn't matter, you need to check the preparation times.  The fastest 
machine in the world can be reduced to slow pig by worms or a failing hard 
disk.  But from the results below I'd say that's not your problem as we'd 
be seeing display errors.

   No, it's an item that's ignored but it's still an item and the delay 
parameter affects it and so comments are a concern when D is 1.

    Well I'd be checking TimeDX's values for that display mode, what you 
see there with an item taking 80 or 81 ticks when it should be taking 81 
ticks pretty much only comes about when the retrace interval is radically 
different than that which is described in the registry.  I'd be seeing if 
the Enhanced Retrace Test really indicates a 60 Hz retrace and not 
something else entirely.
