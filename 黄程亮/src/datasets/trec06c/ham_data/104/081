jonathan,
         Very interesting and possibly very useful.  Is the structure of 
the of the DMDX and TimeDX entries in HKLM\Software and HKLU\Software 
supposed to be or normally the same?  I am thinking that it may be possible 
to just copy the HKLU\Software DMDX and TimeDX sections to 
HL_Users\.Default as a way of setting up the default user.  Up to now I had 
assumed that the HKLM entry was the most important as I have not seen the 
HKLU\Software entries getting much stored in them.  This is probably 
because I normally have DMDX run under a user with administrator rights 
(what I am avoiding this time).

Am I right that the entries dont actually store any timing 
information?  Its just video and audio mode details.

Thanks - I know you are busy but please keep the information flowing, I 
feel I'm getting somewhere.
Peter
