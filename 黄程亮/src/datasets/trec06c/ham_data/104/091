Noah's Wish Sending Disaster Relief Team to Romania to Save Animals in=20
Deadly Flood

Placerville, CA -- July 18, 2005 -- Noah's Wish, an international =
disaster=20
relief organization for animals, is sending a highly skilled and =
experienced=20
team of 4 to Romania.  The team will be departing on Thursday, July 21.=20
Once in Romania they will be working with animal welfare organizations =
to=20
rescue, shelter, and feed animals struggling to survive in the worst=20
flooding to have struck eastern Romania in more than 50 years.

Claudiu Losim, Director of Animed Arad wrote in his desperate appeal for =

help, "When the waters came they (disaster victims) let loose the =
animals to=20
go with God.  We NEED YOU because we have the good intentions but no=20
resources to undertake such an operation."

This disaster began over a week ago, coming on the heels of major =
flooding=20
that occurred in many of the same areas in April and May of this year.  =
As=20
of July 15, a total of 31 out of 42 counties in Romania have been =
severely=20
affected.  Official updates indicate close to 14,000 homes have been =
lost,=20
at least 12,000 people have been evacuated, and over 217,000 acres of=20
farmland alone are under water.  The conservative estimate on the number =
of=20
livestock and poultry that have died is 9,000.  There will be a =
considerably=20
higher number of domesticated animals lost, especially if help does not=20
reach them soon.

According to Noah's Wish Founder and Director, Terri Crisp, "With =
attentions=20
directed towards the current hurricane activity, the disaster in Romania =

seems to have gone unnoticed by everyone but those who are suffering =
through=20
it.  That gives us more reason to need to be there.  Noah's Wish has a=20
wealth of experience and we need to be in Romania using it to save the =
lives=20
of animals and people."

At the latest report, 31 dams and an even greater number of levees have =
been=20
destroyed, leaving few remaining structures in place to hold back the =
water.=20
More rain is predicted in the upcoming week, which will cause additional =

flooding.  This is even more reason why Noah's Wish needs to respond=20
quickly.

Noah's Wish sent a 4 member team to Sri Lanka in January 2005 to assist=20
animals caught in one of the most devastating tsunamis in history.  For =
two=20
weeks the team worked with local animal organizations and veterinarians =
to=20
vaccinate dogs and cats against rabies.  This was done to prevent an=20
outbreak of rabies which would have resulted in the government launching =
a=20
program to eradicate domesticated animals.  As of May 1, over 14,000 =
animals=20
had been vaccinated.

Noah's Wish is the only organization in the world dedicated exclusively =
to=20
rescuing and sheltering animals during disasters.  With over 800 trained =
and=20
experienced volunteers throughout the United States and Canada, this=20
not-for-profit organization is prepared to provide the highest standard =
of=20
services to ensure animals survive when disasters strike.  Having =
responded=20
to 66 major disasters since 1983, Noah's Wish Founder and Director, =
Terri=20
Crisp, is prepared to lead the dedicated Noah's Wish team into any type =
of=20
disaster and make a significant difference for animals and people.
