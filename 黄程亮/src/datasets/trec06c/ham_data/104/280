   The other thing that people hit all the time with constant ISIs is 
having a timeout that's longer than a display.  As long as the subject 
responds before the display's duration is up the stimuli are all perfectly 
timed, as soon as a response comes in that's a little too long the inter 
trial timing goes off.  I can't tell what the syntax of your item is from 
the archives as it's formatting has been mangled but it looks like you're 
using counters both for the frame duration and the timeout.  For debugging 
purposes in the frames that use the counters I would <emit> each one and 
check that their values do indeed meet the required criteria.
