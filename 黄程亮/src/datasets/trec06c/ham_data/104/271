   Have a look at the preparation times in the diagnostics, my bet is that 
your delay of 1 tick (d1) is hopelessly optimistic.  I would suggest a 
minimum of 2 ticks and realistically 3 ticks for items that are just 
presenting text.  You have bitmaps in there so there's almost no way a 
delay of 1 can be possible a even a D of 10 is pushing things.
