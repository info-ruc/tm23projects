Overview

   Various Oracle products and components are affected by multiple
   vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include
   unauthenticated, remote code execution, information disclosure, and
   denial of service.


I. Description

   Oracle released a Critical Patch Update in July 2005 that addresses
   more than forty vulnerabilities in different Oracle products and
   components. The Critical Patch Update provides information about which
   components are affected, what access and authorization are required,
   and how data confidentiality, integrity, and availability may be
   impacted. Public reports describe vulnerabilities related to insecure
   password and temporary file handling and SQL injection.

   US-CERT strongly recommends that sites running Oracle review the
   Critical Patch Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating action
   as appropriate.

   Oracle HTTP Server is based on the Apache HTTP Server. Some Oracle
   products include Java components from Sun Microsystems. According to
   Oracle, the July 2005 Critical Patch Update addresses previously
   disclosed vulnerabilities in Apache and Java. Oracle also notes that
   Oracle Database Client-only installations are not affected by
   vulnerabilities listed in the July 2005 Critical Patch Update.

   US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#613562. As further
   information becomes available, we will publish individual
   Vulnerability Notes.


II. Impact

   The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary depending on product or
   component and configuration. Potential consequences include remote
   execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and
   denial of service. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may
   be able to gain access to sensitive information.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update - July 2005. The update notes that some Oracle
   patches are cumulative while others are not:

     The Oracle Database Server, Enterprise Manager, and the Oracle
     Application Server patches in the Updates are cumulative; each
     successive Critical Patch Update contains the fixes from the
     previous Critical Patch Updates.
     E-Business Suite patches are not cumulative, so E-Business Suite
     customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to
     identify previous fixes they wish to apply.
     Oracle Collaboration Suite patches are not cumulative, so Oracle
     Collaboration Suite customers should refer to previous Critical
     Patch Updates to identify previous fixes they wish to apply. 


Workarounds

   It may be possible to mitigate some vulnerabilities by disabling or
   removing unnecessary components, restricting network access, and
   restricting access to temporary files.

   Oracle Critical Patch Update - July 2005 suggests setting a TNS
   listner password to mitigate a vulnerability in Oracle Database Server
   (DB08).
