Hi Jonathan,
Thanks for all the help, we appreciate it.  The problem continues. 
First, we provide a summary to your questions and recommendations over
the last few emails.  Next, we provide a much simpler item file with
almost everything (counters for display times and time outs,
pre-loading BMP file, etc) stripped out.  It still produces the same
inconsistent timing using RCOT.  The zil file output from two runs of
this item file is also provided.  Any other thoughts?

****************
HERE ARE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (IN CAPS)
****************
Hmm, it's a pretty slow machine that can't load a bitmap in half a
second. But you should be checking the preparation times regardless.

JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE LONG DELAYS WERE NOT DETERMINED SOLELY BASED ON
TIME NEED TO PRESENT THE BMPS.  WE ADDED EXTRA TIME TO THE DELAYS FOR
TIMING ISSUES RELATED TO THE TASK.  ITS NOT A PARTICULARLY OLD OR SLOW
COMPUTER AND WE COULD HAVE USED SHORTER DELAYS IF NEEDED.


Not all items will get displayed as errors, for instance I suspect
instructions are free of any diagnostics for lateness. So your D of 1
might be catching the odd instruction, you've also got comments in
there which will also be affected by the D of 1. Try a D of two or
three and see if the problem doesn't go away

NO INSTRUCTION ITEMS OCCUR ONCE WE START THE TIMING SO THEY COULD NOT
BE THE SOURCE OF THE INCONSISTENCY.

YOU MENTION COMMENTS AS A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD
HAVE ASSUMED THAT TEXT THAT IS COMMENTED OUT WAS DISCARDED PRIOR TO
RUNTIME WHEN DMDX PARSED THE ITEM FILE.  JUST FOR CLARIFICATION, IS
THIS NOT TRUE?   REGARDLESS, IF I DELETE ALL THE COMMENT LINES, THE
TIMING INCONSISTENCY REMAINS

AS I MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER POST, ALTHOUGH WE HAD D1 IN THE HEADER,
WE OVERRODE THAT ON EVERY TRIAL.  HOWEVER, TO BE RIGOROUS, WE CHANGED
THE D IN THE HEADER TO D20 (AND EVEN D60) AND THE PROBLEM REMAINS.  I
HAVE ALSO CHECKED ALL THE PRESENTATION TIMES AND NONE ARE LONGER THAN
15 MS WHEN WE PRE-LOAD THE BMP FILE SO APPARENTLY EVEN THOSE TRIALS
ARE PREPARED VERY QUICKLY.

The other thing that people hit all the time with constant ISIs is
having a timeout that's longer than a display. As long as the subject
responds before the display's duration is up the stimuli are all
perfectly timed, as soon as a response comes in that's a little too
long the inter trial timing goes off. I can't tell what the syntax of
your item is from the archives as it's formatting has been mangled but
it looks like you're using counters both for the frame duration and
the timeout. For debugging purposes in the frames that use the
counters I would <emit> each one and check that their values do indeed
meet the required criteria.

WE WERE AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THE DISPLAY TIME LONGER THAN
THE TIMEOUT AND HAVE CHECKED THIS AS WELL.  MOREOVER, WE ARE NOT
RESPONDING ON ANY TRIAL TO AVOID ANY PROBLEM THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY
RESULT FROM DIFFERENT RESPONSE TIMES.  ON EVERY TRIAL, THERE IS NO
RESPONSE AND THE TRIAL TIMES OUT.  ON EVERY TRIAL, THE TIMEOUT IS
SHORTER THAN THE DELAY FOR THE FRAME WITHIN WHICH WE COLLECT THE
RESPONSE

**********************
Here is the new, very simple item file that also produces the problem.
 If you like, I can send you the bmp file so that you can run this
item file and verify the problem yourself.  We have observed the
problem previously on multiple machines (although, this very simple
item file has only be tested on one right now b/c I am at home today).
 The script and zil file from two runs are provided below.  As you can
see the timing is quite variable across items when using RCOT to
record this.

The Item File:  This is the exact item file we are running.
