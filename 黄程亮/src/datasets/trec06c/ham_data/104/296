Subject: Mini-symposium at ICNAAM on the Computation of Special =
Functions

Due to the great interest for ICNAAM 2005 (International Conference on
Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics), the deadline for
participation and registration has been extended. We invite late
submissions for the mini-symposium

        ON THE COMPUTATION OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS

organized at ICNAAM 2005.

Mini-symposium topic:

Because of the importance of special functions, many of their =
properties,
developed over the centuries, have been collected in formula books.
Since the 1960s, also algorithms and software for the approximation of
special functions have been developed and published.  Many collections
are available now:  on the Internet, in books, in software systems
such as MATLAB, NAG and IMSL, and in computer algebra packages such as
Maple and Mathematica, to mention important (but not all) examples.

However, there is a persistent need for numerical algorithms for all
kinds of special functions. It is the aim of the mini-symposium to bring
together several experts on this topic. Recent results on the numerical
computation of special functions will be presented.

Invited speakers (in alphabetical order):

Dirk Laurie, Nico Temme, Andre Weideman

Organizers:

Annie Cuyt (annie.cuyt@ua.ac.be), Brigitte Verdonk
(brigitte.verdonk@ua.ac.be)

Abstracts should be sent directly to the mini-symposium organizers.
For details on submission deadlines and registration, please refer to
