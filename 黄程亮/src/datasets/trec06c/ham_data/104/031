Dear Colleague,

The National Academy of Sciences and PNAS will convene the 2006 E.Journal 
Summit on Monday, March 20, 2006, from 8.30 am to 4.30 pm in the Lecture 
Room of the National Academy of Sciences, 2100 C Street, NW, Washington, 
DC. The purpose of the summit is to convene leadership from the different 
constituencies in scientific publishing and to stimulate lively discussion 
and debate.

Discussion leaders will frame issues such as publishing and national 
security, changes in journal economics, innovative use of digital 
technology, new archiving models, and advances in free access to research 
literature.

Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to no more than two 
representatives from each organization.

Meeting registration details will be sent in the coming months. We welcome 
your suggestions for discussion leaders and topics.

Sincerely,

Ken Fulton
Executive Director, NAS, and
Publisher, PNAS

Executive Editor, PNAS
