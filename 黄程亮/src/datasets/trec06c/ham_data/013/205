Try Wirz Electronics for the sonar module.  Last I heard, they will sell you
a single unit for about $50, and I'm pretty sure you can order via the web.
Unfortunately, I don't think that they sell the V2X.  You can also get the
sonar module directly from Polaroid, but of course they don't sell the V2X
either.  Don't order the sonar from Mondotronics Robot Store, 'cause you'll
pay 50% more than you have to if you do!

Good luck.
