After sutdying the schmatics for an hour, I got up to get something to
drink.  When I came back I noticed that digital 1 is connected directly
to the IC 1 input line and digital 2 goes to IC2 via a pullup resistor.
It seems that the answer was right in front of my nose or something is
playing a cruel joke and switched manuals on me. :->  I think I get a
good accurate PW measurement through digital 1 providing that I set the
input registers correctly.  Am I correct in thinking this?  Replys, good
and bad are welcome.

Thanks
Mike
