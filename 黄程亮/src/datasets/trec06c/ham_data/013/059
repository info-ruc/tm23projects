I've just been looking into BEAM robotics recently and it is very, very
interesting indeed.
Mark Tilden's claims may be hard to believe and it seems
counter-intuitive, but I think he has his head screwed on right and I
definitely reckon that the "bottom up" approach to AI is the only way
to go in the long run. You wanna check out some of his papers.. follow
some of these BEAM related links:

I can't wait to build one or two of these critters!
