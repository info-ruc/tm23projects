I recently found a game which may interest some of you. You program your
robot using a simple Basic-like language and then let it loose against
other robots (only five allowed in the shareware version).
I haven't played it much yet but for the beginners in robotics out there
(I'm one of them) this could be a good way of learning basic artificial
intelligence.
