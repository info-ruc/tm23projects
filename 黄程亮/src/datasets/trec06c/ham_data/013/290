No I can't believe that the config register is unchangeable, because I own a
single 68hc811e2 that has a correct config, but 12 others that dont, also
these are used in the miniboard pre handyboard? with a config set at 0d, if
i remember my old board settings. There  must be a way to set these chips,
does anyone here have a miniboard or know how to set these other mcu's,??

what is so different about this chip than the a1 that its such a pain to use
the 103f register??

thanks,
Quinn Marshal
