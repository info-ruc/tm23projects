Subject: Rug Warrior Pro download

        Hello everybody on the list,
                                I have a problem that I need help with.
        The University bought two Rug Warrior Pro kits for me to play with 
this year. I have been able to sort the sometimes odd behaviour of Interactive
C. Using IC 3.1 or 3.2 I cam download the pcode to the board. Then it goes:

     Synchronising with board
     pcode version 3.10 Present on Board
     Loading C:\IC\Libs\Lib_rwp.lis
     Loading C:\IC\Libs\Lib_ic.c.
     Loading C:\IC\Libs\Lib_rwp.c.
     Loading C:\IC\Libs\speed.icb
     Loading C:\IC\Libs\shaft.c
     Initialising Interupts
  Board not responding with 98 (b) command

 Then it freezes up and the heart on the board stops.

At no stage has it come up with IC 3.1 on the LCD. 
The other one is working perfectly (so far)

thanks for any help.
