I was wondering if anyone has sucessfully controlled more than two
servos using the handy board. I was thinking of making a 6 legged
walker, however controlling the 12 servos could be a problem. I have
seen some basic stamp based servo controllers that will handle 6 apiece
and are addressed serially, and these look like they will work well. Has
anyone on the list ever played with them?
