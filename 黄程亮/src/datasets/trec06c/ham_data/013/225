Chris,

I got the same problems with the IR detection. I read somewhere that this
is a problem when you use IC and multi processes. The solution could be a
"hog_processor()" statement in the IR routine.

My question to you is. How will you solve the second problem a
Self-Organising Neural Network. Do you have any info on this i.e. what
algorithm can be used?

Thanks in regard,

Emiel Agema
