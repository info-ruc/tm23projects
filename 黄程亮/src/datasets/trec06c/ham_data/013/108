Hi,

After alot of replies to my wall following problem, loads of people 
have suggested bend sensors. Although I have considered these, I do 
not know where to get them in the UK, or any companies that ship them 
in the US.

Does anyone know of any companies either in the UK or the US that 
will do this ??

Thanks

Chris White

P.S. How much are they ??
