Subject: Cheap Sonar
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A while back there was a discussion on cheap sonar. I was wondering if
anyone has tried the sonar device from this page
http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/may97/sonar2.html . If someone has
tried it, could you tell me what you think of it, and if you ran into any
problems using it.

Also, I just put my house up for sale and the real estate agent used a
small sonar device ( AccuTape) to measure the rooms. She told me the cost
of the device was roughly $30-$40. Has anyone tried to use a device like
this for robotics. The device was very small. It was about the size of a
business card.


Thanks
