Yes it most certainly does!.  Any serial port needs a buffer in 
windows, to account for multiple programs that would want to use the 
port.
(ie could have 2 or terminal programs accessing the same serial pot).
Also, Windows may be busy doing something, unable to process serial 
data at that time.  Hence Windows stores input/output to the buffers 
until it can process, and direct the data to various programs.

No you either can not, or it is NOT recommended to disable the FIFO 
buffer. 
If the FIFO buffer was disabled WinNT (and Win95 to some extend) 
programs will not be able to get any serial data. This is due to 
WinNT virtualising machine I/O calls, allowing programs to 
read/write to the buffer only (not the port directly).
