Mike, 
U11  is the motor driver nearest the start button that drives motors 2 and
3.
The #2 pin  is the second pin back on the chip nearest the start button.
See page #2 of the Handyboard assembling manual.
I followed Tom Brusehaver instructions at the
handyboard/software/contrib/tomb/readme    Be carefull not to reverse any
wires and you will do just fine.
I have the v2x socketed on a pref board ,code loaded and the thing works
just fine. When I type at the IC prompt    v2x();  it constantly prints the
current heading.
My problem is not knowing enough about writing code.  I would like my bot
to go in one direction for a number of wheel rotations then
another-----ect.   I don't think  the compass is going to work very well
inside but should work fine outdoors.
 Please let me know when you when you get a workable code. If you could
share a working code I could change variables to suite my needs. 

				Good Luck
				Terry P. Gathright
