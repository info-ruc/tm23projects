                    CALL FOR PAPERS --  CP98
---------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Fourth International Conference on
          Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming

                 Pisa, Italy, October 26--30, 1998
                    http://www.di.unipi.it/cp98/
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Scope of the conference:
-----------------------
Constraints have emerged as the basis of a representational and
computational paradigm that draws from many disciplines and can be
brought to bear on many problem domains. The conference is concerned
with all aspects of computing with constraints including: algorithms,
applications, environments, languages, models, systems. Contributions
are welcome from any discipline concerned with constraints, including:
artificial intelligence, combinatorial algorithms, computational logic,
concurrent computation, databases, discrete mathematics, operations
research, programming languages, symbolic computation. We also solicit
papers from any domain employing constraints, including: computational
linguistics, configuration, decision support, design, diagnosis, graphics,
hardware verification, molecular biology, planning, qualitative reasoning,
real-time systems, resource allocation, robotics, scheduling, software
engineering, temporal reasoning, vision, visualization, user interfaces.
Papers that bridge disciplines or combine theory and practice are
especially welcome.

Paper submissions:
------------------
Authors should submit abstracts by April 20 and original full papers of no
more than 15 pages by April 24. Submission should be done by sending two
emails to cp98@ilog.fr.  The first email should have subject: CP'98 abstract
followed by the paper title; the body should contain the title, authors and
a short abstract of the paper in plain text. This email must be sent by
April 20. The second email should have subject: CP'98 paper followed by the
paper title; the body should contain a postscript file. For authors who are
unable to submit electronically, five paper copies can be mailed to one of
the program chairs. In that case the package should arrive no later than
April 24.

Publication:
------------
The proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the Constraints
journal (Kluwer Academic Publishers) is planned, based on selected papers.

Conference Format and Program:
------------------------------
CP98 will take place in Pisa, a pleasant small town in the Tuscany region
of Italy. The conference will be five days long from Monday to Friday.
The invited speakers are Joxan Jaffar (National University of Singapore),
Patrick Prosser (University of Strathclyde, UK), and Peter Jeavons
(Royal Holloway, University of London).

Workshops:
----------
Satellite workshops will be organized on Friday, October 30. Workshop
proposals can be submitted to the workshop chair by March 27, 1998.
The details can be found in the call for workshop proposal, which can
be seen on the CP98 web page.

Important dates:
----------------
-- April 20, 1998: abstract submissions
-- April 24, 1998: paper submissions
-- July 2, 1988: acceptance decisions
