Subject: Need help finding a A1 chip.

Hi All,

I have come across a RugWarrior board that I think has a bad uC chip.  I
don't want to pull the chip form my HB to test it just in case I'm
wrong. (turn one working and one not into two not)  My question is where
can I find another 68HC11A1FN chip and do they sell in single
quantities?

Thanks
Mike
