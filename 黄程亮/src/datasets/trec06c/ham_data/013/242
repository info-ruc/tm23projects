Here is a good web site for hexapods that can be run from a 6811 cpu, with
schematics and the ic .c files as well, it is a handyboard/rugwarrior board
that can run 12-(14?) R.C. servos directly. simple and works well, got mine
running in one evening.

PS. I got a 68HC811e2 (2k eeprom model vs. 512 bytes) cpu and I have one
that works perfectly with the handyboard, the config i set to 0c, I ordered
12 more from motorola and they all came with a 0xFF set config register, and
the same method that i used for my first cpu doesnt work? does anyone have
any sugestions?

I really need to get these working, thanks,
Quinn Marshal
