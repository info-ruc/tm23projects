Subject: Re: 68HC811E2 Can't be set

I had the same problem with an A1, in this case it was stuck at 0x0D.  hbdl
would NOT set the config, but I was able to do it with dl from Win95 run in
full MS-DOS mode.  Even this was problematical; dl would invariably hang the
computer once or twice, necessitating a complete reboot, but eventually it
worked, and I only had to make it work once.  Note that dl won't work with
the E2, you'll have to try dlm.  See the HB Tech Reference Section 4.3
