Well, owing to the apparent level of traffic related to this subject, and
the fact that I have a working configuration that supports both 19.34.6 and
20.2.1 under both NT and 95, I've wrapped up all my ange-ftp stuff into a
single zip file and put it on my web site (url at the bottom of the
message).

This includes the ftp.exe that supports PASV connections for multiple
firewall traversal.

Lastly, while I am using the agne-ftp.el/elc as distributed with the
respective versions of NTemacs, I am using different (more recent) versions
of comint.el and custom.el and friends - these are included in the
ange-ftp-kit.zip.

I can't claim to be a guru on the subject, but my configure *does* work, and
works through a WinGate2 FTP proxy (e.g.: ^X-^F
"/anonymous@ftp.microsoft.com:" works as expected).

Regards,
-Ted
