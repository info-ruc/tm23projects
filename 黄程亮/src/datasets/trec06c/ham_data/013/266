Can you hook up RC servo signal inputs  to the motor drivers?
It looks to be feasable as both require a pulse width modulated 
signal but I'm not sure if the motor driver's carrier frequency and 
range of pulse widths is suitable. Any ideas - it would be good is it 
can be done as it makes walking robots "easy" to construct.
