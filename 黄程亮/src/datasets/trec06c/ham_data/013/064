Sure.  Use an oscilloscope.

It seems to me that if you're looking to hook up the receiver to the HB,
couldn't you instead just run the receiver output through a capacitor to
smooth it out (and maybe a resistor to scale the voltage) and into an HB
analog port, so that instead of a variable PWM signal you're basically just
reading a variable DC voltage signal?  Keep in mind, though:  I'm an
electronic neophyte, and so anything I suggest should be taken with a grain
of salt about this big:

      |   typical grain dimension   |

I think it's great that you have a practical application for your robot
(inspecting the pipes under your house).  Mine's just another way to annoy
the cat, so far.  Always glad hear from those who are doing something useful
with their toys (like searching for land mines, etc.).  Good luck.
