sounds like my chip.
Is your config Register stuck at 0xFF like mine is?
then entire 103f register is all FF, this is how it came from motorola when
I ordered it. and I cant seem to get it to do anything other than boot with
pcbug, but without a 0c config its no good for the handyboards/rug, how do u
set this thing??

thanks,

Quinn Marshal
