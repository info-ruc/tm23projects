Bar-Ilan Workshop on KDD -- Knowledge Discovery in Databases

May 20-21, 1998

Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel

   CALL FOR PAPERS/PRESENTATIONS

The Bar-Ilan Research Institute for Computer Science will sponsor a
workshop on Knowledge Discovery to be held May 20-21, 1998 at the
university.  Submissions of short papers or presentations from academia
and industry are solicited in this Call.

Invited hour speakers (to date):

        Haym Hirsh (Rutgers Univ.)
        Oren Etzioni (Univ. Washington)
        Ronen Feldman (Bar-Ilan Univ.)
        Simon Kasif (Univ. of Illinios, Chicago)

Other participants to be announced.

Knowledge discovery from data is a broad discipline that integrates methods
from machine learning, statistics, databases, rule-based systems, and
other areas.  It includes algorithms for data selection, pattern
discovery, clustering, managing uncertainty, and trend analysis.

Submissions are invited for research papers and presentations.
Topics to be covered include but are not limited to the following:
        Text Mining
        Pattern Matching for KDD
        Rule Extraction
        Algorithm Complexity and Lower Bounds
        Incremental Discovery Methods



A short 1-3 page extended
abstract should be sent to Prof. Martin Golumbic, (golumbic@cs.biu.ac.il)
no later than April 20, 1998.  Decisions for acceptance will be ongoing
and usually within 2 weeks of the submission.  An on-line proceedings
of extended abstracts will be made available shortly before the workshop.
