Dear Friend,

I hope my email meets you well. I am in need of your assistance. My 
name is SGT. GERALDINE MARCUS,  I am in the Engineering military unit here in 
Ba'qubah in Iraq, we have about $65 Million US dollars that we want to move out of the country. My partners and I need a good partner someone we can trust. It is oil money and legal. 
But we are moving it through diplomatic means, to send it to your house directly or a bank of your choice using diplomatic courier service.The most important thing is that \ul CAN WE TRUST YOU\ulnone ? Once the funds get to you, 
you will take your 35% out and keep our own 65%. Your own part of this deal is to find a safe place where the funds can be sent to and kept. Our own part is sending it to your doorstep where the consignment will be delivered to you.If you are interested you will need to give me your address, telephone and fax number where the diplomat will reacch you as soon as he arrives your country and i will furnish you with more details that will facilitate your immediate access to the fund.  But the whole process is simple and we must keep a low profile at all times. Please reply me with this email for security purposes  <sgtgeraldmarcus@virgilio.it>
Thanking you and waiting for your urgent and favourable response.
Regards,
SGT GERALDINE MARCUS.
