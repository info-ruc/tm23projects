I'm looking for a source, probably US based, for the Polaroid 6500
ranging kit and the Vector  2x compass. 

Does anyone know a source that sells both of the components. I'm trying
to save myself two seperate international airmail costs to New Zealand.
The source would need to allow web purchases.

Does any one have any alternate components that may be worth looking at?
