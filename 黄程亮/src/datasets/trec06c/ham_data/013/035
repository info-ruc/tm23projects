Hello,

Like Hans Christian Gilje I am interested if anybody tried to connect a
Psion (3A) to the handyboard?
Also I want to ask if someone can hand me some ideas about
troubleshooting the sonar 6500, it gives strange random values, and yes
I did place the 0.1 uF capacitor.
That is, I put a square shaped one in it, not a round one.
There is this text on it:  .1m100
Would that be ok ?
Does it matter how you place these kind of capacitors (- , +) ?

Thanks,

Jan Luijk.
