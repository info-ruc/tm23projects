The correct actual addresses are indeed all in the
$10xx range.  When you index off either the X or Y
register, the offset value is only 8 bits, or 0 to
$FF.  This is why you're getting the warning
messages, the high order $1000 is being ignored.

You do not have to use the indexed method to
address the registers, these are all equivilent:

        LDA    #$1020
and
        LDX    #$1000
        LDA    $20,X
and
        LDX    #$1000
        LDA    $1020,X    <--- gives warning, high
order $1000 ignored.

The equates allow you to use either direct or
indexed addressing to get at the registers.  The
only reason for using the indexed method is to
save 1 byte on each such instruction.
