Could someone please explain to an electronics bonehead like myself the
following:

(1) What is meant by open collector (and what is the alternative)?

(2) How can I determine whether the Polaroid 6500 module ECHO output is open
collector (the IC is a TL851 PID614904 DIGITAL, if that helps)?

(3) What sort of signal contention might there be if it's not open
collector, and could the situation be remedied with a couple diodes, like this?

     module 1____|\|____
         ECHO    |/|    \
                diode    \________Handy Board
                         /        Port A0/TIC3
     module 2____|\|____/
         ECHO    |/|
                diode

(4) If the above boneheaded scheme were to work, what sort of diode would I use?

(5) Would there be any problem splitting the BINH signal to go two modules
like this?
                                   _______module 1
                                  /       BINH
     Handy Board____/\  /\  _____/
         Port D4      \/  \/     \
                     1 kOhm       \_______module 2
                                          BINH

Thanks again to all the electronics experts out there who help keep us
boneheads from frying our circuits more often than necessary.
