<p class="boxtitle" align="center">Once news of the EPA approval becomes widely known, the stock could go ballistic<br> This virus has already surpassed $10 billion in its global impact</p>

<div class="Chicken"></div> Since 1997 when Hong Kong officials reported the H5N1 viral outbreak of avian (bird) flu, 151 million domestic birds have died or been destroyed as the result of this killer disease.<br><br> The loss to agriculture now tops $10 billion and efforts to contain the disease with quarantines and culling of flocks have apparently failed.<br><br>  EFSF investors could see fortunes made as the rush gets underway to contain and stop H5N1 avian flu virus.

<p class="head">Can you imagine the revenue and profit from a product with this kind of potential?<br><br>
 Since EPA approval has already been announced, I anticipate that eFoodSafety stock (EFSF) will not stay at today's share price for very long You must consider this opportunity now.</p>
 
 <p align="right"><strong>*EPA Registration No. 82723-1</strong></p>

<span class="head style1">Dear Profit-Seeking Investor:</span>

<p>There's a lot at stake here so let me start with the news that could create a fortune in profits for you very shortly.</p>

<p>-- I anticipate you could see a quick 2- to 3-fold leap off today's EFSF share prices following news that eFoodSafety has received EPA approval for its non-toxic Big Six Plus germicidal.</p>

<p>-- This has been the key news the company has been waiting for.news that will finally open the doors to a global market for an environmentally safe, non-toxic answer to the H5N1 avian flu virus crisis.</p>

<p>-- The profit potential for investors is simply enormous.</p>

<p>-- My first upside target of $2 puts EFSF in 670% gain potential.</p>

<p>-- My second target could be so explosive, it might easily blow past a ten-bagger I'll be publishing my forecasts and sell signals in The KonLin Letter.</p>

<p>-- What's driving this forecast is that eFoodSafety now has its non-toxic anti-viral formula ready for global distribution.</p>

<p>-- Now that it's received EPA approval, eFoodSafety Big Six Plus germicidal could quickly be disseminated worldwide, used to combat one of the most urgent health crises in human history, H5N1 avian flu virus.</p>

<p>-- Let me begin with a quick review of the toll that H5N1 avian flu virus has taken thus far. Since its outbreak.</p>

       <ul> 
	   <li> 151 million domestic birds have died or been killed,</li>
       <li> $10 billion has been lost in agricultural economies, and sadly,</li>
       <li> 131 people have died even before the viral mutation that World Health Organization officials are saying would trigger a global pandemic of Biblical proportions.</li>
		</ul> 

<p>-- As horrendous as these data are, here is the figure that staggers the imagination.</p>

<p>-- At present, about 50% of human patients who contract avian flu could die from the disease, creating a lethal risk of 180-300 million human deaths according to one highly regarded researcher.</p>

<p>-- It's that serious. Ira Longini, from Emory University's Department of Biostatistics demonstrated the need for an effective, non-toxic weapon to stop the spread of disease using data obtained from an epidemic simulation over 5,625 square kilometers of rural Thailand.</p>

<p>-- Longini reports, "You have two to three weeks, if it starts in a rural area, to contain the disease."  Longini goes on to say, "With a reasonably small stockpile of antiviral prophylaxis, you can contain it with a high probability."</p>

<p>-- Please note the phrase: "antiviral prophylaxis."</p>

<p>-- Prophylaxis means applying the remedy before the cure.</p>

   <p> Longini's assessment brings home the importance of a response like what may be possible with the non-toxic eFoodSafety Big Six Plus formula.</p>

    <strong><p>This is exactly the use for which Big Six Plus germicidal is intended.</p></strong>

<p>-- I can imagine the stampede of countries seeking supplies of Big Six Plus to clean up H5N1 avian flu virus breakouts or stop them from occurring in the first place.</p>

<p>-- Is that going to happen? It's not guaranteed, but I for one do not want to be on the sidelines should this stampede get started. I own this stock myself and have made it my #1 stock pick for 2006. My subscribers are also ready and you could be too.</p>

<p>-- Just look at how much America will spend.with no outbreak yet on our soil</p>

<p class="head" align="center">$3.8 billion has been approved for.<br>
combating H5N1 avian flu virus in America</p>

<p align="justify">In November last year, President Bush proposed a whopping $7.1 billion budget to prevent the spread of H5N1 avian flu virus to America. By Christmas, Congress had approved $3.8 billion of that request.</p>

<p align="justify">-- Worldwide, you can anticipate that billions more will be spent attempting to stop H5N1 avian flu virus from spreading further.</p>

<p align="justify">-- When that kind of money is thrown at a problem of this magnitude, fortunes will be made, of that you can be certain.</p>


    <p class="head" align="center">What's more, further tests suggest that a similar eFoodSafety<br> formula can be used as an oral treatment for influenza patients.<br><br>

<strong>Human trials are already underway</strong></p>

<p>Clinical trials at one of America's top pharmaceutical testing laboratories, Bucks County Clinical Research, are being conducted to show that eFoodSafety's Citroxin O2 germicidal formula can kill influenza A & B virus in vivo. (Since no patients can be tested with H5N1 avian flu virus, the efficacy against H5N1 avian flu virus virus will be inferred.)</p>

<p>-- This is the same research lab that routinely tests for major pharmaceutical companies like Roche, Bristol Myers and others.</p>

    <strong><p>There's even evidence that the germicidal formula could lead to an effective therapy for the common cold Wouldn't that be nice...and profitable</p></strong>

<p class="head style1" align="center">In agricultural applications, Big Six Plus can be sprayed almost anywhere that H5N1 avian flu virus is found.in chicken coops, poultry feed, nesting areas, food processing areas, etc. It's even being considered as an additive to poultry feed for prevention or treatment of disease.</p>

<p>So why is eFoodSafety's product not being sprayed from airplanes right now? Good question. Now that the EPA has signed it off as non-toxic, it may w ell come to that</p>

-- After all...something must be used to stop H5N1 avian flu virus.and this could be it


<p class="head" align="center">Big Six Plus is proven effective.proven safe.and ready for global sales<br>
It's non-toxic to humans and animals, can be used almost anywhere.<br>
And it's devastating to a long list of pathogens such as these nasty bugs:</p>

    <strong>It eradicates black mold.the destroyer of homes</strong>
    <p>-- eFoodSafety has been selling the Citroxin cleaner for its proven, 100% effectiveness at wiping out the black mold (stachybotrys chartarum) overrunning hurricane-ravaged areas of the South. Unlike the toxic, marginally effective alternatives, Citroxin can be sprayed cost-effectively without immediate or lasting impact on humans, animals or the environment. I expect significant sales from this product in the coming year.</p>

    <strong>It sanitizes food, prep surfaces, restaurants, hospitals and more destroying the EPA's 6 worst bacterial pathogens</strong>
    <p>-- Earlier in 2005, I alerted my readers to the announcement that eFoodSafety Big Six Plus germicidal passed all tests for safely and completely eradicating the EPA's six most dangerous bacterial pathogens:</p>

           <ul> 
		    <ol> 1. e-coli</ol>
            <ol> 2. listeria</ol>
            <ol> 3. pseudomonoas</ol>
            <ol> 4. salmonella</ol>
            <ol> 5. staphylococcus</ol>
            <ol> 6. streptococcus</ol>
			</ul>

<p> -- Big Six Plus is proven completely effective when used on hard and porous surfaces making it highly desirable for routine use in hospitals, kitchens, food storage areas, and many more locations where disease can be spread. I expect huge sales from this product line.</p>

<p>-- Tests also prove that it's 100% safe to spray and use around animals, food and humans, largely because the formula is comprised of nothing but food-safe components, previously approved by the FDA and EPA</p>

<p>-- This has created an incredible buying opportunity for EFSF Since the market has completely missed its latest announcement, you could make a fortune off eFoodSafety stock (EFSF) that you buy today.</p>

<p>-- Last September, rumors of a breakthrough appear to have triggered a 24-hour, 214% share price explosion in EFSF stock. (9/12/05)...which are poised for tremendous share price growth as the company is moving toward fulfillment of its stated objectives.</p>

<p class="head" align="center">Now that rumors have been verified, EFSF has become an urgent "Buy Now" opportunity</p>

<p>I would not wait to make your move. I firmly believe that eFoodSafety could quickly skyrocket once this recently announced news reaches market ears.</p>

That's not all.

<p>eFoodSafety has more products in the pipeline, some already generating revenue that could make the company hugely profitable as early as this year</p>

<p class="head" align="center">And most important, eFoodSafety is about to achieve positive cash flow</p>

It's rare that an investor can find a ground-floor opportunity with explosive growth potential that has already established positive fundamentals.

<p>-- eFoodSafety hit this landmark early this year, which is why I'm urging investors to move quickly on its stock (EFSF). This buying opportunity can't last much longer</p>

<p>-- Here are a few of the products, in addition to Big Six Plus germicide, that are carrying eFoodSafety into the future...and could be featured in coming news releases:</p>

<p class="head" align="center">TalsynT CI/bid Scar Cream<br>
The most efficacious scar cream on the market today, entering a $4 billion market.</p>

<p>Talsyn is effective in the treatment of new and old scars and is particularly promising to the cosmetic surgery segment where 9.2 million procedures are performed annually.</p>

<p>-- Talsyn also works to reduce old scars by an average of 62% over an 8-9 week treatment regimen. Available only through a physician, the product's acceptance in surgery and clinics is soaring making it a potential huge 
revenue stream in 2006.</p>

<p class="head" align="center">CinnergenT non-prescription diabetes product<br>
Sales are already surpassing expectations on this important new product.</p>

Diabetes is becoming one of the fastest growing chronic health problems in America's aging population. It's currently a $132 billion market.

<p>-- Cinnergen encapsulates a proven effective naturally occurring compound found in common cinnamon that can supplement subscription diabetes medications and help decrease medication needs in type 2 diabetic and borderline patients.</p>

<p>-- Cinnergen can also forestall diabetes onset in at-risk patients. Distribution is already underway at Drugstore.com and Richard's Whole Foods. Expect more in the works for major retail drug chains.</p>

<p class="head" align="center">TrimmendousT weight loss aid<br>
Staking a claim on a $33 billion market with a promising new weight-loss therapy that is both compelling and unique.</p>

This product is an ephedrine-free weight loss product that is specifically formulated for a two-dose regimen, one for morning use and one for pre-bedtime use.

<p>-- Trimmendous improves metabolism and lifts energy levels without using risky stimulants. This product enters a huge weight loss marketplace that, though crowded with claims, has unique selling and performance benefits that could readily capture a significant share of that market.</p>

-- As progress moves forward, I expect even greater gains with EFSF that I will forecast and follow for readers of The KonLin Letter.

<p>P.S. Regular readers of The KonLin Letter know I do not make timing forecasts for buying and selling my picks. When we see value, we recommend a buy. And when it comes time to sell, we pull the trigger and take our profits or losses.</p>

<p>-- On the horizon:</p>

-- It obliterates Anthrax spore s on hard and porous surfaces
<p>-- eFoodSafety's anthrax sporicidal also meets all EPA protocol guidelines for a 100% kill of the surrogate organisms used for the testing against anthrax. EPA registration is underway and should be approved yet this year. With this product, the bio-terror threat of weaponized anthrax could be completely neutered.</p>

-- Also...

<p>-- Watch for an announcement soon about an exciting new eFoodSafety skin care product that is reported to be better than the wildly popular "ProactivT" line of products. If this pans out as I think it will, it could be a tremendous announcement for investors</p>
