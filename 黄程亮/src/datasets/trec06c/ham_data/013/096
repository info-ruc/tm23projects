Subject: Re: Wall Following

I wrote a similar type scenario using a PIC (pre handyboard user)...
The trick I found was not to rely on a single return, but multiple.  That
is, use a counter, to count the number of hits.  Use 64 as a base number,
count down for each hit, up for a miss (always max 64)... You get the idea,
when the counter reaches 0, youre probably damn close to something....
I used 256, at 1ms between shots, left and right transmitters with a common
receiver (Mobile Robots, Inspiration.. Chapter 5), for the hardware design
and a lot of playing for the software.  I didn't move very fast about
1"/sec, so could afford the multiple hits.  Your mileage may vary.
