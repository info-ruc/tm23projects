I was wondering if anyone has used IR transmission in their programs and
if so, do you have a bit of simple sample code i could take a look at and
if you knew variable ranges or anything.

Also..does anyone know a common household material that will stop infrared
transmissions within a foot or so?  I built some shielding for the ir
reciever with some bits i cut from an AOL CDROm so it can localize where
the signal is coming from and go there.  
The problem is that its only good at insulating once you get outside of
this about 3ft. zone around it.
