Hi All,

A major problem, that has been the bain of my life for the last 3 
months. I am a third year undergraduate at the University of 
Sheffield, England, and for my dissertation I am undertaking a 
project entitled Autonomous Mobile Robotics. My aim in this project 
is to build a robot from a Fischertechnik kit, and control it with a 
6.270 board, with the aim being firstly to wall follow, and secondly 
to build a Self-Organising Neural Network representation of the 
environment.

Problem is the infra-red !! I have spent many weeks trying to get the 
robot to follow walls using infra-red, and various other methods, but 
to no avail !! The infra-red is too tempramental, or too sensitive to 
be of any use. Has anyone else had any experiences like myslef, that 
couold possibly help ??

Regards

Chris
