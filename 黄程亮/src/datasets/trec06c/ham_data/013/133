Dear Dr. West:

The National Science Foundation hereby awards a grant of $525,000 to The

This award is effective March 1, 1998 and expires February 28, 1999.

This is a continuing grant which has been approved on scientific /

             FY1999 $525,000

This grant is awarded pursuant to the authority of the National Science
Foundation Act of 1950 (42 U.S.C. 1861 et seq.) and is subject to GC-1

The amount of cost sharing must be documented (on an annual and

included as part of the annual progress and final project report.

The attached budget indicates the amounts, by categories, on which NSF
