Hello All,

I am attempting to display characters on the Handy Board screen, 
using pure assembly.

I know the routine needs to be copied to internal RAM, put in single 
chip mode, then activate the display - as stated by the hardware 
reference manual.
But this documenation, (and any other documentation I could find for 
the Handy Board) does NOT adequately explain how to do it.

So I was hoping someone may have written an assembly / machine code 
routine that will display something on screen.
Hence provide code I can build from.

Thanking you,
