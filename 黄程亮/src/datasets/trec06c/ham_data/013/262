Subject: Cannot download :(

I had several problems downloading from a P166 on Com2 running Win95, and
found the following solutions worked.

1.  Go to Control Panel, System, Device Manager, Ports, Com2 and select
properties.  Set for 1200 bps; 8; none; and 1.  Click the Advanced button,
leave FIFO buffers enabled, but move both sliders to the left (low).  

2.  You may (as I did) have a problem with your serial cable, especially if
you are coming from a 9-pin port.  Fred helped me with this; write me if you
need pin-mappings for these cables.
