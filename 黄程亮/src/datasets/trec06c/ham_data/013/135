Anyone,
      Hi, I've hooked up a Polaroid 6500 sonar to my HandyBoard;
following the specifications in from the Hardware section in
the Handyboard homepage. I've also downloaded the sonar.c file
and downloaded onto the handyboard. Now here's the problem:
I ran sonar_init()
Then I ran sonar_sample() and I got a -1 as the result
So I ran sonar_display() and I still got the -1 ("******")
I did hear the clicking of the transducer. Now I looked through
that code and I think narrowed it down to the program not getting
an ECHO back and it timesout. I tried testing it off of objects from 
5" to about 18" away, and I still kept getting -1.
Can anyone help ?

Thanks in advance.
                                                 -CD
