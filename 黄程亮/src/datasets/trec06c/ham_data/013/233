I have had the same problems with my P133 desktop running W95.
Other stuff communicated fine through com1 but the HB would not work.
After I changed the setting for recive buffer and transmit buffer to the
lowest value possible (min) it worked fine.

May be this helps solving some problems.

Good luck,

JB
