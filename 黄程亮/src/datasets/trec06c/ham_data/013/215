Oh man, do I know this song by heart!  Thanks Steven.

YESTERDAY (You know the tune)

 Yesterday,
 All those backups seemed a waste of pay. 
 Now my database has gone away.
 Oh I believe in yesterday.

 Suddenly,
 There's not half the files there used to be, 
 And there's a deadline
 hanging over me.
 The system crashed so suddenly.

 I pushed something wrong
 What it was I could not say.
 Now my data's gone
 and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

 Yesterday,
 The need for back-ups seemed so far away. 
 Thought all my data was here to stay,
 Now I believe in yesterday.
