I ran into the same problem. I was unable to set it with any of the
utilities for the handyboard. I ended up using my mini-board and its
download software to correctly set the register. I don't know why it
worked.

No I can't believe that the config register is unchangeable, because I own
a
single 68hc811e2 that has a correct config, but 12 others that dont, also
these are used in the miniboard pre handyboard? with a config set at 0d, if
i remember my old board settings. There  must be a way to set these chips,
does anyone here have a miniboard or know how to set these other mcu's,??
what is so different about this chip than the a1 that its such a pain to
use
the 103f register??
thanks,
Quinn Marshal
