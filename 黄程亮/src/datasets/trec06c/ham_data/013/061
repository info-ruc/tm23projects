Subject: Help reading pulsewidth.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi all.

Is there a way for me to read the pulsewidth comming out of a RC
receiver?  What I'm trying to do is to have an onboard Futaba R/C
receiver just in case my bot gets into trouble that it can't get out of
on it's own.  I want to use my HB controlled robot to inspect the pipes
under my house.  I would hate to have to go under the house to retrieve
it which is why I'm sending the robot in the first place.  I figure that
if I can read two channels of the receiver I could take direct control
if need be.  I  have the video transmitter and color video camera
pointing up at a 45 degree angle.  If I could read four channels I could
mount the camera on a pan and tilt platform and maybe use it as an
emersive VR system.

Thanks
Mike
