I am currently using an MSCC11 from Novasoft with a program called
Servo16 (I actually think the version I am using is called something
different but the original program was Servo16). This can control up to
16 servos, the first 12 can be configured to run a 'walk' so that all
the handyboard has to do is send one command to the MSCC11 and then it
is free to do other things.

I haven't assembled the walker yet due to time limitations but I have
tried the servos connected to it and it runs fine.

I hope this is of help.
