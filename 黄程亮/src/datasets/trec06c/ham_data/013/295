This won't work, as the servo's require a one-shot, not a variable 
duty cycle type of pwm (like what comes from the motor drivers on the 
HB). ie. the width of any given pulse is not consistent, just the 
overall duty cycle. RC servo's require a consistent pulse output 
centered around 1500ms, which is the neutral position. Actually, I've 
found that with Futaba servos, the neutral pulse width is about 
1350ms.

         hope this helps, Duncan
