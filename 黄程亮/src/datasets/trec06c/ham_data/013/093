Thanks All,

With the help you provided I think PipeBot will be a success.  It is
about to go on it's first test sortie under the house with an umbilical
and tether.  The umbilical is tied to three of the digital inputs so I
can take over control if nessesary.  There was a trade off in that I had
to lose the rear bump sensors to free up more inputs.  Has anybody had
any luck on using the expansion header and a 'hc374 for more inputs?  Is
the expansion board going to be released anytime soon?  Well the time is
comming to send my bot on it's way.

Again, thanks
Mike
