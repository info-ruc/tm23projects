Correction:  the problem has been the *bane* of your life--not the bain.
I'm the bain of everyone's life.

The best solution to the problem that I've seen is in the 6.270 Robot
Builder's Guide, which can be downloaded off of the documents page of the
Handy Board web site.  Fred Martin describes the bend sensors that were
developed for the Nintendo Power Glove.  They're used as variable resistance
feelers for very precise positioning from walls, etc.  Unfortunately, I
don't know where to buy them.  Maybe someone else on list could tell us
where we could buy these bend sensors?
