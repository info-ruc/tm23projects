I have a couple of the original sonar modules made by Texas Instruments (I
think these are the ones the article is describing) and they work just like
the model 6500 ones that Polariod now sells. You can also get them from
http://wirz.com/

The connector on these TI sonar boards has a different pinout from the
current model 6500 but I was still able to get them to work with a Handy
Board. 

I don't think TI makes them anymore. These were bought back in 92-93.
