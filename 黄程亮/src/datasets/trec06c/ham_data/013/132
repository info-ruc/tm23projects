Ed - FYI - I sent this on March 19, right after I rec'd the following from
NSF - I will schedule an in person meeting within the next couple of weeks
to go over everything - in the meantime, if anyone has any questions  -
please contact me via email or voice mail....Hope this helps..

All - what would help at this time is a current contact list for the NSF
award coordination from each of the three campuses - I haven't heard from
any of the campuses in quite a while.

Subject: Grant augmentation process to cover subscription fees

You should have received a copy of the MCI subscription agreement from Neil
van Duinen of MCI. To receive reimbursement from NSF for the subscription
fee, please fax us a letter signed by an institutional representative
requesting the supplement, a copy of the MCI agreement signed by your
institution, and a copy of NSF Form 1030 (Budget Summary) signed by you and
the institutional representative.  A sample format for the letter is
attached below.  Original copies are not needed.

If you are connected and can execute the subscription fee contract with
MCI, your Form 1030 should reflect the subscription fee period from April
1, 1998 through March 31, 1999. For a DS-3 connection that totals $43,000,
and for OC-3 $130,000. In addition, if you have received only the first
increment of your award, you should include the remainder of your award on
the Form 1030.  Consorta should submit a combined budget and signed
contracts for each member institution.

If you can't execute your subscription fee contract by April 1 or aren't
yet connected to the vBNS, please contact Dave Staudt at dstaudt@nsf.gov or
703 306 1949 so this can be handled on a case by case basis.

Please feel free to call or write with questions.
Doug & Dave

>>Hi - congratulations on receiving a high performance connection award.
>>There's a lot of interest in these awards and we're already being pressed
>>to provide information on them.  We find the best way to respond is to
>>refer folks to our web page, which has the list of awards, a clickable map,
>>and hot links to the web pages of the awardee institutions.  Its URL is:
>>http://www.cise.nsf.gov/anir/hp-connections.html
>>
>>To provide some sense of consistency we would appreciate your providing a
>>web page describing your project and including the following information:
>>
>>  1) Description of the project and the part the NSF grant will
>>     play.  Please reference the NSF award number.
>>
>>  2) Contact information for those wishing to get additional
>>     information about the project.
>>
>>  3) Meritorious research being supported and the institutions
>>     participating in the research.  This can be titles alone
>>     and/or links to other URLs.  Under each research topic,
>>     include the participating institutions.  URLs to those
>>     institutions would be acceptable but not necessary.
>>
>>  5) A description of the high performance connection supporting
>>     the meritorious research.  Please include the physical
>>     equipment and network topology which shows how the links
>>     support and enhance the campus infrastructure as well as
>>     provide the connection to the vBNS.
>>
>>  6) Your anticipated schedule for implementation.
>>
>>  7) A description of how you will be supporting quality of
>>     service requirements and performance measurements
>>
>>  8) Anything else you would like to make available.  We get
>>     frequent requests for copies of winning proposals, so an
>>     on-line copy of your proposal would be very useful to others
>>     in the community, and would also help provide some of the
>>     information requested above.  Feel free to delete anything
>>     which you consider violates privacy, etc.
>>
>>Please send me the URL as soon as you can, even though your web page is not
>>complete or is under construction. We expect the information to be dynamic
>>and to change over time.  If you have more than one institution in your
>>award, please pass this message to the appropriate people and coordinate
>>sending the URLs to me.
>>
>>Feel free to contact me with questions or comments.        Dave
