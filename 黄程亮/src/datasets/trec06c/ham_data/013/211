I had a similar problem, and while I couldn't exactly fix it, I managed to
avoid it as follows:  I had a serial mouse on COM1 and the HB plugged into
COM2.  I could *not* download like this no matter what I tried.  So, on a
whim, I found a 9 to 25 pin adapter plug and swapped ports.  All of the
sudden, with the mouse on COM2 and the HB on COM1, everything worked fine.
I've heard of others having trouble with the HB on COM2 also, but so far
I've not heard an adequate explanation for this strange behavior.  I
sincerely hope that your problem is as easy to solve as mine was; it sounds
just about as exasperating.  Good luck.

PS--Do double check to verify that you're using the correct types of cables
(the one from the computer to the serial interface board and the one from
there to the HB).  There are two distinct wirings for each of these two
kinds of cable, and I can't keep 'em straight myself <:]  Check the
documentation and e-mail archives if you're not sure.
