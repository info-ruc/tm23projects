The "fast" processors are legendary for having problems with loading IC pcode and
libraries.  Probably, your board is fine.

Have you looked at the page on the HB website having to do with com problems?
It's at
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/winindex.html,
and is a good place to start.  If you cannot get anywhere from there, then go to
my site and look at the "Basic Introduction to the TCOMP."  This is a description
on how to get PCbug to run on the HC11 (along with some other helpful stuff).  It
is written for my board (the Super T) but it will work just fine on the HB.  It
won't help you solve your com problems, but it will tell for sure if your board
is working or not.  After that, it's a matter of fiddling with the port settings
on your computer.

Don't give up.  As soon as you get past this problem with communications, it gets
easier.
