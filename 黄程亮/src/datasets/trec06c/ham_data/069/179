I don't suppose you know what the formula is for calculating the value of the
frequency ?.  1/(R4*C6) possibly ?. This equation gives 38396Hz (38.4KHz) which
means that my 6.6nF caps give 39560Hz (39.6KHz) which is closer to 40KHz than
the 6.8nF value listed. I would appreciate confirmation of this before I decide
which component to use.

Thanks for your help
