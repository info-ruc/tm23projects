To any good Samaritan,

I'm helping to assemble an experiment at the
University of Toronto.  The experiment is a
controlled reading task (using some DMDX
code offered by Ken earlier in this thread).
The following is the case:

1) Each sentence is presented as a number 
of different items
2) The sentences vary in length

As an example (not in the experiment, obviously):

! First sentence
+1 <umb +Space><mpr +Space> "I" * <cr>;
+2 <umb +Space><mpr +Space> "think." * <cr>;

! Second sentence
+3 <umb +Space><mpr +Space> "Therefore" * <cr>;
+4 <umb +Space><mpr +Space> "I" * <cr>;
+5 <umb +Space><mpr +Space> "am." * <cr>;

We wish to scramble a presentation of such sentences,
but the order of items making up an individual sentence
must remain constant.  Can this be accomplished in
DMDX?

Thanks in advance,

Rick Dale
