I need to build a circuit that will listen for a 3.5kHz tone and then activate
a program on the Handyboard. I have seen a few different circuits in various
books but none seem tailored to my specific needs. Does anyone out there have
a good electret condenser microphone amplifying circuit for the Handyboard and
can the handyboard decode the tone or should I build a 567 tone decoder
circuit also. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
