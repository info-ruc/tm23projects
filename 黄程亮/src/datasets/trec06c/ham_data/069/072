Hi all,

I am currently fabricating my new HBoard based robot and have only gotten to
the design stages. I have ordered a Vector 2x but haven't recieved it yet. I
am not particularly well endowed with electronics or assembly language skills
(very little except that I knew enough  to correctly solder my board together
by following instructions)I can program adequately in IC.

I have looked at the Vector 2x stuff submitted by Tom Brushaver (sp?) and am
not sure it will work with my setup. It looks like his method requires the use
of motor ports or something.

Has anyone successfully implemented one of these things using the HBoard and
expansion board without permanent modifications?

Most importantly, can anyone give explicit instructions(with info on what
other components are needed, connection from pins on the Vector 2x to the
specific I/O ports on the Hboard and Expansion Board, code if possible) and
even software to get one of these working?

Any tips on mounting to reduce interference of the mag field?

Thanks all,

Bob K.
