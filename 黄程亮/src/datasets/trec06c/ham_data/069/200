Subject: HB power drain
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Does anybody know what sort of power drain the HB has when it is not
driving any outputs (servos or motors) ?. The reason I ask is that I am
thinking of having a rechargable 9v PP3 battery connected as a reserve
battery so that when the main battery gets too low the HB can shutdown
it's outputs to conserve power and when the battery finally gets too low
to power the HB it can swap to the 9v battery (about 120mAh) for
extended HB life. At the point that it shuts down the outputs it would
trigger a recovers signal of some form but I haven't gone into this that
much yet.

Thanks

John Hatton
