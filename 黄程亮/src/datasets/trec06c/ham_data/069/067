Subject: 6.8nF Capacitor
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have got all the parts for building my HB except for a 6.8 nF 2%
capacitor (component C6). Maplin Electronics have stop doing it and I am
not sure where to try next. I am in the UK, does any body know if I can
change the resistors in the infrared transmission circuit to use a
different capacitor (as I assume it is used for timing purposes) or
where I am likely to be able to get one from.

Thanks for any help anybody can offer.
