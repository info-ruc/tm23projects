Hi.  Sorry if this is a repost.  I don't think I was able to post this
message last time.

This is a silly question:  What is a bobbin(sp)?  I tried to find its
function on-line or in textbooks, but I couldn't find much.  A friend gave
me a box filled with robot parts, including these things call bobbin.  What
are they?
