Isn't a bobbin part of a sewing machine? I distinctly remember it being the
thing underneath the needle that you needed to load with thread to make the
whole thing work.

Aha, a look at websters gives me the following definition:

5. (Elec.) A cylindrical or spool-shaped coil or insulated wire, usually
containing a core of soft iron which becomes magnetic when the wire is
traversed by an electrical current.
