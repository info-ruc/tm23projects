Greetings all,

Has anyone managed to work out some code which checks the overflow bit =
for the counter used in the polaroid sonar code? At the moment mine =
distance readings seem to be maxing out around 1.5m or so, and I'm not =
sure if it's the timer running out or if it's my circuit not having =
enough gain to receive a signal from further than that.

I've had two conflicting answers with regards to the maximum time that =
can be measured - one which says about 1.5m and another which says =
somewhere closer to 8-10m.

Can anyone (Fred?) give me an answer?

Thanks for your help,

Adam
