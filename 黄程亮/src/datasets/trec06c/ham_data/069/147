Hi,

I am planning to build a position detector with a H2000 chip. The chip
is used in several optical mice, for example the H2000/0006 can be found
inside the Microsoft IntelliEye mouse.
I sill have difficulties in finding the manufacturer and the proper
datasheet of the chip. Furthermore I have tried to find information on
the technique applied in optical mice and similar chips but without any
success so far.

I have searched all common suppliers with www.findchips.com and I have
searched the web for hours- in vain. A similar question was posted one
year ago on the HB mailing list, but the author was not able to find any
information either.

Grateful for any suggestions
Stephan
