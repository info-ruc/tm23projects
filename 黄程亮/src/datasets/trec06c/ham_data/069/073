Hi Robert,
It has been over a year since I have had the vector 2x connected to my board
but if you follow the instructions  that Tom Brusehaver posted in
contributed software everything should work ok.  You will have to connect to
one of the motor driver chips but it's no big problem, I just shoved a wire
along side pin #2 of the 16 pin DIP motor chip for motors 2 and 3.  I
mounted the v2x on a aluminum angle 2' above the motors. It worked fair
inside and great outdoors.
    Every now and then the compass would "hang-up" but you can reset by
monterialy grounding one of the pins, that information is in Tom's
instructions.
    I would like to reconnect the v2x to my board but have installed the
expansion board  and have not seen any  information posted as how to do it.
The code below was in the software downloaded from Tom Brusehaver's
compass. zip file.
Let us know how it turns out.
Bye
Terry G.

/* compass testing miniboard */

void v2x()
{
 comp_init(1);

 printf("\nCompass Init..\n");
 beep();

 start_process(take_readings());
}


void take_readings()
{
 int heading,tmp;

 while(1)
 {
  heading = head_word;
  printf("Heading %d (0x%x)\n", heading,head_word);
  sleep(0.5);  /* otherwise the display blinks! */
 }
}

/* int main()  */
/* {           */
/*  v2x(); */
/* }           */
