I have recently obtain a handyboard kit.
This is my first board.
After connecting the Ni-Cad batteries and adapter, I proceeded to download
therequired .s19 file using HBDL.
It was unsuccessful.

The LCD screen displayed one line of brightly lighted squares.
I checked the LCD +5V supply, it was alright. What could be wrong?

I suspect that my battery connection may have some problems, how should I
check if my batterie are sound could they be shorted. tested one of the ,
voltage was okay but the current reads 6A. Is my multimeter not working?
I am using the recommended 1.2V 600mA bettaries

The RED LEDs for the motor O/P also lightes up when I tried to go into
bootstrap. The Red and Green LEDs no lightup for 1/3 sec and go off during the
process.


I would really appreciate any help/guidence


Thanks in advance,
Raymond
