there's not really a big diff in the performance of the ir sensors
given 38 or 40 khz.  so either is fine, +/- a few khz just doesn't
really matter, you have to detune 10 khz or so for it to matter.

there is an issue whereby there are two different varieties of hc132
chips, and depending on which kind you have, you need a very different
R value (or C, but R is easier to change).

here's more info:

  *** re: R4's value.  Depending on the variety of the manufacture of
  the HC132 chip, R4 should be either 3.83K (Digikey 3.83KXBK-ND) or
  6.81K (Digikey 6.81KXBK-ND).  To test this, type "bit_set(0x1000,
  0x40);" from the IC command line, and when the IR output circuit is
  active (as evidenced by the IR OUT LED9 being on), measure the
  frequency at pin 3 of the HC132.  It should be 38 to 40 kHz.  Use the
  6.81K resistor to lower the frequency if it's too high; use the 3.83K
  resistor to raise it if it's too low.

this info is avail in the latest parts list, at:
