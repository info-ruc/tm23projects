Subject: Any work on using normal IR readings?

Has anyone done any work on using simple IR sensors as (short) range-finders /
proximity detectors? Basically a reflectance sensor, but with a discrete
infrared emitter and detector. One of the problems you notice right away when
using these is that color and texture greatly affect them. A white object at
two inches might return 75, but a green object at 2 inches might return 12.
Has anyone put any effort into trying to determine what and where the object
actually is based on a series of readings?

(if you're interested, I have notes on how to construct these and some sample
data at http://plan.mcs.drexel.edu/projects/legorobots/)
