Hi all, I'm having some problems with me previously functioning
handyboard.
 
I'm using a standard board which has worked fine for nearly a year.  
Recently it didn't get any use for awhile and the batteries ran down.  
After charging them for 18+ hours I downloaded the pcode and it appeared
to work fine for awhile.
 
Now if I turn it on one of several things happen:
 
1. Med-dark grey block in the top line of the LCD.
 
2. It will come on for a moment and then the red & green power/on lights
will glow brightly and it will reset for no apparent reason.  I can't seem
to get it to work with IC since the board keeps resetting on its own.
 
I checked the battery with the volt meter and it appeared that, at first,
it was only seeing .5 volts from the power-expansion headers, but then
when it came on it was back up to its 10.x volts, full charge.  Odd I
thought.
 
Anyone experience this before?
 
Thanks in advance,
