   Hmm, the non-USB PROPAD 6 gamepad that I have lists it's name as "PROPAD 
6" in the TimeDX input test -- but that were you trouble then there'd be 
error messages.

   It's not wrong, just extraneous, if the code is working properly then it 
will just be skipping the extra delimiter, if it's broken then that'll be 
fixing it.  Unfortunately I'm not going to be looking at it for a while, I 
am deep in the middle of the version 2 re-write, when that's done I will 
have time to investigate what's causing people trouble here.

   My guess is that there is something new and interesting happening here, 
some new interaction between having a USB device and DMDX polling it every 
millisecond.  Unfortunately I don't have a USB gamepad to test this with, 
if you want me to investigate it you'll have to send me one of the devices.

   As stated in the documentation it will poll at a 3ms data rate.

You may be sure that when a man begins to call himself a "realist," he
is preparing to do something he is secretly ashamed of doing.
