Subject: 470uF Capacitor (C3)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Just a quick question, how important to the poser supply of the HB is
the 470uF axial electrolytic capacitor ?. I made the mistake of getting
a 64V version thinking that this would be ok and as it is installed
under the LCD the rather large cap that I now have is a bit too big. I
am intending on getting a replacement but if it is not 100% essential I
can continue construction.

Thanks for your help.
