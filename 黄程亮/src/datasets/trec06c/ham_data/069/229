Subject: PWM decoding
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Has any body used the HB to decode the PWM signals from a radio control
receiver ?. I'm not sure if it can be done (I haven't looked that deeply
into it yet) but I am construction a six legged walker with the twelve
servos being controlled by a single HC11 processor. The HB interfaces to
the leg controller, I was thinking of whether it would be possible
(mainly for testing purposes) for the HB to decode a 2 channel RC signal
(forward/back and left/right) and send the relevant commands to the leg
controller.

Any ideas ?.

Thanks
