The 6.6nF was the capacitance measured for the two 6.8nF capacitors that
I have managed to get (rated as 10% tolerance). The problem is that the
parts listed for the HB are 2% tolerance 6.8nF capacitors which gives a
lowest value of 6.6664nF which is higher than the values that I have
got. I was wondering how much of an effect the 0.2 nF discrepency would
have on the IR transmission circuitry's effectiveness.
