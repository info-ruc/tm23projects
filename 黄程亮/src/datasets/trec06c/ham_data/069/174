Could I add a more specific question: I'm trying to set up DMDX to run on a 
new Viglen PIII 600, which has an ATI Rage XL video card. The machine is 
going to be one of about 50 in a practical lab, and they are all running 
Windows 2000 (for some reason we can't get the machines supported by 
computer services with any other operating system). The plan is to use DMDX 
to run class experiments next term.

TimeDX (Version 1.05) seems to crash a fair bit when setting up (no 
message--it just pops out into Windows), but it is possible to set up 
parameters that work reasonably well. But then DMDX comes up with:

GetDC for memory surface failed!
DDERR_CANTCREATEDC (88760249)
Windows can not create any more DCs

at irregular intervals. The program then generally grinds to a halt and the 
computer needs to be rebooted. The control file I used for testing was a 
simple visual lexical decision experiment that works on other machines 
without any problems.

Any ideas or suggestions welcomed.

Thanks,

Gareth Gaskell
