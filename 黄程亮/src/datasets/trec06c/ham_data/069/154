DMDXers -

I bought gamepad Propad 8 USB which is capable of polling
0.045ms, base time 1ms in the Input test. Since I am interested
in recording 1ms latency I believed that by setting <id "joystick
1" 10,1> gamepad will be able to poll responses within 1ms as
suggested in the manual.

Unfortunately the program freezes with this settings. Since I
assumed that this hardware is not capable of polling 1ms, I tried
to change setting to the default <id "joystick 1" 10,3> for the
joysticks and gamepads, but it still continued to freeze. 

I further had checked similar correspondence (check "Input Device
and polling messages" from March 2000) and found similar
problems. To summarize: Input test recognized gamepad device as a
joystick 1 over USB. When I tried to changed id setting 10,1 or
10, 3 or 10,10 or 15,10 program freezes (without this numbers it
works).

When I used  <id "joystick 1" ,10,1> it works (note comma) (the
guy in march 2000 correspondence did similar thing) and no one
commented that this is wrong.
 
What would happen if I omit numbers and just put <id "joystick 1"
>? Will it stick with the default values or will poll as fastest as possible? I would appreciate help on this since it is possible that there is some vagueness concerning this polling matter. 
 
Thanks,
