Yes, I encounter something similar.  Do you use servo on your board?  I also
have some trouble with the motor ports.  I am not sure what causes it.  I
also have trouble with the motor ports.  When I run the motor at 50% power
(back or forward), both red and green LED on the port light up at the same
time.  If I detach the motor from the port, the LEDs light work fine.  I am
trying to figure out what is going on myself...
