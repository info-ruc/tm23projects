If you want to return to "base," all you need is a beacon of some sort. For
example, you could use CdS cells (or anything that finds EM in the visible
light/low IR range) and a lightbulb (or series of lightbulbs, like a strand
of Christms tree lights, that lead to a higher-emitting diode that indicates
base), or a sonar transmitter/reciever pair, and create a behaviour called
'return' that looks for the signal and moves in that direction.

If you wanted to be more advanced and definitely return to the base, you
could also make sonar beacons for positioning (at different frequencies so
it doesn't get confused), and tell the return behaviour that home is, say,
beacon one distance x, beacon two distance y, beacon three distance z, and
to go there (by, perhaps, finding beacon distance one, followint it to
beacon distance two, and if that doesn't have beacon distance z, continue on
until you hit beacon distance two and three).

Of course, all three have their pluses and minuses, like the light bulb
would only work so far, the sonar signals bounce off the wall, the CdS cells
work best for light seeking in the dark, the sonar triangulation lets you
make a map if you desire to...
