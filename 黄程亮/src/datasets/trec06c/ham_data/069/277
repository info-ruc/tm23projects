Subject: IR Serial comms
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have recently come across an interesting IC being sold by RS
Electronics in the UK. It is an IR transceiver IC which effectively gets
connected to a normal serial UART and then just acts as though there was
a physical cable in place. The IC does not only do this, it can receive
and transmit TV remote signals as well as providing a direct access for
cpu control of the modulation. The serial connection is capable of
connection speeds of 1200bps to 115Kbps which is pretty impressive, so
it should easily cope with the connection rate of the HB serial comms.
Unfortunately it only seems to be available as a surface mount module
but I'm sure anybody wanting to use it could come up with something
(soldering wires to each leg and bringing them out onto pins of a
standard 20 pin DIP socket ?). The IC itself is 7.2mm long and 5.3mm
wide (7.8 if you include the legs) so it is tiny, and it only costs
about 6 GBP (english pounds for anybody not familiar with the
abbrevation) so, as you need two, for about 12 GBP plus a few extra
components (capacitors, resistors, crystal if not running on a local
clock signal, IR LED, and PIN diode to receive the IR signal) you can
have a wireless IR comms system fo the HB and as the unit (including the
IC and extra components) is reasonably small so it could possibly be
simply left connected to the HB and your robot could be roaming around
the room while still communicating with the PC.

If anybody is interested the IC is a CS8130 Multi-standard InfraRed
Transceiver made by the Crystal Semiconductor Company.

Hope this is useful to somebody.
