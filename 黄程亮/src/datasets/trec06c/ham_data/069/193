   Yes and if there's one area win2k is currently woeful in it's drivers 
and more specifically, video drivers.  Basically I saw DMDX run on one of 
my machines without a hitch, it runs on a very wide range on of other 
hardware and OS configurations so it's not likely to be an error in 
DMDX.  Also, that particular company stands out in my mind as providing 
shoddy drivers.

   They aren't a buffer, they describe the device's context, which font 
will be used, what size it is, whether it's italic or not, etc etc 
etc.  That device can be a bitmap in memory, a video display, a printer, 
anything that can be drawn upon.  95 is limited to something like 16384 
DCs, everything else is probably only limited by system resources.  Errors 
like the one reported are caused by DCs not be being destroyed when a 
program is finished with them.
