Hi,

Just wanted to get some advice about presenting bmp's in dmdx 
version 1.1.13- the images are black and white photos and the 
quality is very poor when they are run in dmdx.  They are all 
saved as 24bit files and the image is of good quality in 
paintshop and in timedx version 1.05 when you run a video mode 
test, any ideas why the images are degraded in dmdx?  I have 
tried saving them with different amounts of colours used but this 
doesn't seem to make any difference.

Thanks for any advice
Emma
