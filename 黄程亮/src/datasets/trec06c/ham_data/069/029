	Field testing in a real class is the best way to get bugs out of
code :-)  My summer robotics class discovered a couple of "misfeatures"
in my new random.c pseudo-random number generator library:

(1)	the rndrangei(), rndrangel(), and rnd() functions could not return
	the upper bound of the range.  E.g., rndrangei(0,2,1) would return
	only 0 or 1, never 2.

(2)	Fred Martin's original random() function is already defined in
	lib_hb.c, so Handy Board users would get a "function already
	defined" error when trying to load random.c.  (The 6.270 board
	standard library, lib_r22.c, doesn't have a random() function,
	so I, running a 6.270-based course, included it in my random.c.)

	I have fixed these errors and created a revised version 2.1 of
random.c.  It is available via anonymous FTP at:

	ftp://junior.apk.net/pub/users/drushel/rfd-ic/random.c

Please update to the new version if you're using random.c.  If you edited
your lib_hb.c to remove random() to avoid the duplicate definition, you'll
have to put it back...fortunately, I just commented out the code in
random.c, so you can cut/paste it back in.

	As always, let me know if you have any problems or find any bugs.
