Subject: IR Sensor Hack
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wrote the following email to Mekatronix regarding the sensor hack to
convert Sharp GP1U58X or Y sensors to IR range finder sensors. The pdf
documentation currently on their website just shows how to solder onto a
trace within the sensor to give an analogue value with a rise time of about
100ms. I have dug out some of my original documentation that I obtained
from either them or from the University of Florida site. This mentions
replacing the surface mounted 0.1uF cap with a cap of the range 5 - 10nF to
give a 1-2ms rise/fall time (the author managed less than 1ms using the 5nF
option). The reason I am posting this here as well is to find out if
anybody else has made this modification and knows which is the easiest way
to replace the surface mounted capacitor.

Thanks for any help.
