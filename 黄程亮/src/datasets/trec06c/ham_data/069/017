Dear j.c.f,
How could I display my graphic files together with pretrial fixation
point display and post-trial masking?
I have used a parameter file like this:

N16 <s 8> <azk> <cr> <nfb> f38 <t 4000> <id "keyboard"> <dbc 0> <dwc 
000255000> <vm 640 480 480 16 0> <mnr +left shift> <mpr +right shift>
$
0 "Press SPACEBAR to start";
$
+1 <bmp> "fixation" <bmp> "target" /<ms% 2000>/ ;
$
0 "The End.Thanx";
$

but what I recieved was an error indicating that multiple media
files cannot be displayed together. In other words, how could I
display three graphic files one after another and whils showing
the third (i.e. the mask) have the subjets answer?
Sincerely,
Bahador Bahrami
