I bought gamepad Propad 8 USB which is capable of polling 0.045ms, base time 1ms in the Input test. Since I am interested in recording 1ms latency I believed that by setting <id "joystick 1" 10,1> gamepad will be able to poll responses within 1ms as suggested in the manual.
Unfortunately the program freezes with this settings. Since I assumed that this hardware is not capable of polling 1ms, I tried to change setting to the default <id "joystick 1" 10,3> for the joysticks and gamepads, but it still continued to freeze. 
    I further had checked similar correspondence (check "Input Device and pooling messages" from March 2000) and found similar problems. 
To summarize: Input test recognized gamepad device as a joystick 1 over USB . When I tried to changed id setting 10,1 or 10, 3 or 10,10 or 15,10 program freezes (without this numbers it works).
When I used  <id "joystick 1" ,10,1> it works (note comma) (the guy in march 2000 correspondence did similar thing) and Forster did not comment that this is wrong.

What would happen if I omit numbers and just put <id "joystick 1" >? Will it stick with the default values or will poll as fastest as possible?
I would appreciate help on this since it is possible that there is some vagueness concerning this pooling matter. 

Thanks,
 
Mario
