A while ago, I wrote a script (in AWK) that merges a file with codings
with your result files. That is, it needs a file that looks approximately
like this:
  item: 123  coding:  seashore  2432  groupB related
  <etc>

After calling the script, your AZK file will be rewritten from:
  +123 1245
to:
  +123  1245  seashore  2432  groupB  related

Which is enough to keep SPSS and Splus happy :-)

The script is was not made with a larger audience than me in mind, but I'm
happy to give it to anyone interested.
