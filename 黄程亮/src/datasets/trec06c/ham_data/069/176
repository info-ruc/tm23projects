   I tested it on a K6 running win2k and it ran so it's a green 
light.  Win2k still appears to be suffering from some bad drivers on a 
couple of motherboards w.r.t. the performance timer (that or one of the 
developers on the support listserve can't write code, a possibility), an 
Asus P2B and another 440BX based board (don't recall which, think it was 
Abit).  I can release the current version of TimeDX v2, it won't store any 
values in the registry that DMDX v1 can use but it does have a millisecond 
timer test that will trap any bad behavior by the performance counter, you 
might have to run the test for an hour or two just to be sure though.

   Just be aware that you can't use anything that accesses the hardware 
directly under win2k, like the PIO12 or the RawJoystick devices.
