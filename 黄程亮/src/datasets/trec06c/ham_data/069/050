I also tried all sorts of capacitors, etc. in an attempt at solving this
problem.  While the capacitors helped to minimize the length of time before
the motors calmed down, there was always a short period of motor craziness
that never went away.

I solved it on my handyboard in the following manner:

I cut the trace where we are told to cut it if we decide to put external
motor power to the board, and then I installed a jumper block with jumper
(like from a computer motherboard) across the cut trace.  When I want to
power up the handyboard, I remove the jumper, turn on the handyboard, wait a
second for the handyboard to reset, and then supply power to the motors by
installing the jumper.

I have been having the same motors spinning on powerup "problem" with my
Handyboard.  I tried various capacitor combinations on my modified servo
motors
to no effect.  Fred M. finally provided the answer:

>>there's nothing that can be done about it, sorry.  when the board is
>>first turned on, there's a 1/3 sec period when the motor output latch
>>has a random state.  then the cpu comes out of reset and clears it.

In short, there is nothing wrong with your board or motors based on the
symptoms
you described.  My solution is to just pick up the robot as I turn it on and
expect that the wheels will turn for an instant (this keeps me from dropping
it
when the spinning wheels startle me).  The other option is to unplug the
motors
on powerup.  I may switch to a single motor plug (with both of my motors on
one
6 place/4 pin connector) to simplify plugging and unplugging the motors.
