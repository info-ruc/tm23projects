This is my routine to use the Vector 2x with my board (see link below my =
name)
with an I/O expansion board connected.  You will need to change the I/O p=
ort
#defines to work with the Handy Board I/O ports on your expansion board, =
but
other than that it should work fine.  The compass is used in slave mode w=
ith this
routine, so connect the pins accordingly (some go to ground, some to +5, =
follow
your manual).

To set up the compass, you will need to call reset_compass() from your ma=
in()
routine, and then when you want to see what it has to say, use the read()
function.

#define porth 0x7C00     /* ignore this, it is for setting data direction=
 on my
board */
#define set_h bit_set(0x7e00,0b00000100)

#define pc_low bit_clear(porth,0b00100000)  /* these next 4 ports will be=
 digital
outputs on your board */
#define pc_high bit_set(porth,0b00100000)

#define sclk_low bit_clear(porth,0b01000000)  /* "porth" is port h on my =
board,
not a new instruction :-) */
#define sclk_high bit_set(porth,0b01000000)

#define ss_low bit_clear(porth,0b00001000)
#define ss_high bit_set(porth,0b00001000)

#define reset_low bit_clear(porth,0b00010000)
#define reset_high bit_set(porth,0b00010000)

#define read_sdo input_j(1)  /* these will be digitial input points on yo=
ur board
*/
#define check_eoc input_j(0)  /*                  ditto                  =
      */



void reset_compass()
 {set_h;
  poke(porth,0);  /* this clears all the outputs in general, you may just=
 want to
clear some of them on your board, depending on what else you have connect=
ed */
  ss_high;
  pc_high;
  sclk_high;
  reset_high;
  reset_low;
  msleep(15L);
  reset_high;
  msleep(5L);}


int read()
  {int i;
   int j;
   int heading;

   heading=3D0;

   sclk_high;
   ss_high;
   msleep(15L);
   pc_low;
   msleep(15L);
   pc_high;

   while(!check_eoc)
    {;}

   msleep(15L);
   ss_low;
   msleep(15L);

   for(i=3D1;i<8;i++)
    {sclk_low;
     msleep(5L);
     sclk_high;
     msleep(5L);}

   sclk_low;
   msleep(5L);
   sclk_high;
   msleep(5L);
   if(read_sdo=3D=3D1)
     {heading=3D256;}

   msleep(15L);
   for(j=3D7;j>0;j--)
    {sclk_low;
     msleep(10L);
     sclk_high;
     msleep(10L);
     if(read_sdo !=3D 0)
      {heading +=3D(int)((2.^(float)(j))+1.);}}
   sclk_low;
   msleep(5L);

   pc_high;
    sclk_high;

   return heading;}

A couple of things to note:

1.  Since this is done in IC, the routine is too slow to pick up the last=
 bit on
the heading, degrading maximum accuracy to +/- 2=B0

2.  The Vector 2X doesn't work very well indoors due to disturbances in t=
he
magnetic field caused by metalic objects and other fields.

3.  Because of 2., 1. doesn't matter much.

4.  There is a good way to compensate for the errors caused by indoors us=
e.  You
must calibrate for the fields as they exist in your robot lab, and then t=
he
compass will provide headings that you can use.  Email me when you get to=
 that
point.

Good luck,

Gary Livick
