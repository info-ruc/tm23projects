Hello -

When we wish to encode information concerning a trial into the
item numbers, we associate the relevant information (e.g.
condition) with a numerical scale, and multiply by powers of 10. 
To get the information back out, we pull the data into a
spreadsheet and use the mod operator.  The data are then ready to
be pulled into a statistical analysis package.  This seems to be
a common scheme.
