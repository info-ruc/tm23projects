I am putting together a somewhat modular robot:  The main controller and
batteries are to be connected to peripheral motors (and controller) via cable--
around 5 feet distance.  I'm looking for a connection cable that has enough
pins for my data and electronic power/ground lines, but is hefty enough for
the motor power and ground lines.

All in all, I figure I need 6 low current lines and 2 high current lines
(potentially carrying a few amps) -- or, maybe a few medium current lines to
split up the load.  Preferably, the cables would be compact; most importantly,
I don't want any bulky plugs cluttering and adding weight.  (Cable thickness
is less of an issue.)  8P8C RJ45 would perfect, but I am pretty sure it
couldn't carry the currents I need.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Jake
