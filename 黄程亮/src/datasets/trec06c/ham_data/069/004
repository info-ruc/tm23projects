I am attempting to get a head start on a school project using the handybo=
ard. =

However, I can't seem to find a good place to purchase the necessary LEGO=

components.  I would prefer to not have to buy a Technic set.  I don't ne=
ed
most of the components.  I only need some gears, several worm gears, seve=
ral
of the long parts with the axle holes through them, sensors, etc.  Does a=
nyone
know where I could find a place to select only the parts I need?  Or does=

someone have any part they wish to sell?

Thank you,
