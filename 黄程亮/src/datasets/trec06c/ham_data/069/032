This problem is very common.  Probably, your board is fine.  Check this page on
the Handyboard site to start off with :
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/winindex.html

If you have no luck with that, then try fooling with your port settings.  Switch
from xon-xoff to none, etc.

Somewhere in there is your answer.

Good luck,
