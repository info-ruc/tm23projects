Subject: Sharp GP2D12-Sensor under sunlight?

Hi,
    I am working on a robot with the HandyBoard.  I am thinking about using
the Sharp GP2D12-Sensor because the other IR reflective sensors I use won't
work under sunlight.  I read the spec. sheet of GP2D02 and GP2D05, both of
them mention that they work well under sunlight.  But GP2D12 and GP2D15
spec. sheet didn't mention such feature.  I was wondering if anyone have
used the GP2D12 under sunlight?  How well does it work?
    What other cheap sensors would anyone suggest if I need the robot
running under sunlight?
