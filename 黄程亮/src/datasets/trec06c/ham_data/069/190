Is the reason you suggest that Gareth gets new video drivers because W2K
interacts with video drivers, cards and DirectX differently from 98/95?  

I gained the following half baked knowledge from talking to a programmer
colleague.  Is any of it correct or even getting there? (Oh how I enjoy
displaying my complete ignorance to the whole world!)

...here goes...

DC's (Device Contexts) a created when drawing to the screen and they are
some kind of buffer for video display information.  There can be a limit on
how many can be created and this may be controlled by Windows or the video
card.  95/98 probably has a different limit from W2K on the number you can
create so you should make sure your video driver is specifically for W2K.
