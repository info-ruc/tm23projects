I have been having the same motors spinning on powerup "problem" with my
Handyboard.  I tried various capacitor combinations on my modified servo motors
to no effect.  Fred M. finally provided the answer:

>>there's nothing that can be done about it, sorry.  when the board is
>>first turned on, there's a 1/3 sec period when the motor output latch
>>has a random state.  then the cpu comes out of reset and clears it.

In short, there is nothing wrong with your board or motors based on the symptoms
you described.  My solution is to just pick up the robot as I turn it on and
expect that the wheels will turn for an instant (this keeps me from dropping it
when the spinning wheels startle me).  The other option is to unplug the motors
on powerup.  I may switch to a single motor plug (with both of my motors on one
6 place/4 pin connector) to simplify plugging and unplugging the motors.
