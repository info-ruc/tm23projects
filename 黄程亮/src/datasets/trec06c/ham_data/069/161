   Looks like people are going to have to avoid Windows 2000 on a 
multi-processor motherboard, it appears that the high performance timer 
DMDX uses returns different values depending upon which CPU is executing -- 
and it's not a bug, it's a feature, thanks MS.  Also there appears to be an 
outright error on Asus P2B motherboards (a single CPU MB) under win2k 
reading the performance timer so stick to win98.
