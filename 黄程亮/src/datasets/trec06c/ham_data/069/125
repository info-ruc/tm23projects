Hi,

Is it normal that any time I start IC, and the HB sinchronize with it, all
the programs in the memory are erased, and there is only the ones the IC
download at that moment (the ones in lib_hb.lis) ? If not, what can be the
problem? If I use the HB
alone, turning it on and off , I have no problems with the memory contents.

Thank You

Jose Luis
