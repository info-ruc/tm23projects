Hi.  Sorry if this is a repost.  I don't think I was able to post this
message last time.

I am thinking about putting three GP2D12 sensors on port 28, 29, 30
(because I am not thinking about using Lego Sensor, and I really like other
analogue ports with the 1K pull-up resistors).  Has anyone done it?  Or is
it a bad idea to uses these ports for this sensor?  I think all I need is to
cut the trace at the 10K pull-up, right?
