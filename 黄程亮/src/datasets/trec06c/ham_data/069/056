I have three GP2D12s running on a Handyboard and they seem to run quite well in
sunlight.  In overcast or indirect light (shade) their performance seems
identical to indoor light.  In bright sunlight there seems to be a possible
shortening of the range but I haven't recalibrated them outdoors to see how much
the response curve changes.

What is your application for them?
