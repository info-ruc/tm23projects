   I am assured by MS that this is not by design, it is a 
bug...somewhere.  So the version 2 TimeDX millisecond timer test will have 
code to check for QPC errors, only time will tell how long you have to run 
the test before you can be assured that your machine doesn't have these 
glitches.  One thing seems certain, '98 is free of any QPC glitches and 
win2k is not.
