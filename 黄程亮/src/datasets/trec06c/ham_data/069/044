Hi

I think that the longest distance your able to measure is about 2.7m. The
counter is 16 bit long and has no sign. But the integer is has a sign, so you
can only use 15 bits, which is 32768. The counter increases each 0.5ns (pink
book). Sound travels at approximatly 340m/s.

32768*0.0000005*340/2=2.78m

If you need longer distances, you need do handle with the overflow bit. I
wasn't successful until no. The next few month i will not have the time to get
one with that. So if you find a solution, please let me know.

Bye

Martin
