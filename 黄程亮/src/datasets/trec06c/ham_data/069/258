Hi,
    This past few days, I notice my board uses up the battery very quickly
(may be because I use servos).  Then I notice that the voltage regulator at
U13 heats up very quickly.  I was wondering if I short-circuit somewhere.  I
didn't build the board, but I build the sensors.  Is it normal for the
voltage regulator to heat up??
