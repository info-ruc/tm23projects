I've been trying to buy some GP2D12s with no luck.  None of the suppliers that
were recommended to me by
Sharp has them in stock.  They estimate it'll take at least 90 days to get them.

The good news is that they quoted me a price of only $6 each for quantities of
5-10.

Does anybody know where I can buy some of these today?
