Ok, So it looks like this:

Jeff has a car and is driving.  Dan has a car and is driving.  I guess that
is about 6 or seven seats.  I will be riding down on a bicycle.  And Anne
looks like she'll be driving down late in the afternoon.  Yot may also be
driving down.  All the email addresses are contained in the header, can
people arrange their own rides?  I will be leaving here around 10.  The
bicycle trip is about 1 hour so i'll be there around 11.  The weather looks
great!

Saul.
