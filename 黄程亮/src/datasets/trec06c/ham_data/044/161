You are wise to be suspicious.  You do not say what values
you computed, but I get 
f(0,0,0) = f(2,2,0) = 0.6568...; f(1,1,0) = 1; f(2,1,0) = 0.
Considering the graph of f(r) shows f(X, Y, Z) = [0, 1].

By my computation, naive interval arithmetic gives
f(X, Y, Z) in [-5, 6.6568...]:
r = sqrt ( [-1, 1]^2 + [-1, 1]^2 + [0, 0]^2)
  = sqrt ( [0, 2] )
  = [0, sqrt (2)]
f = 2*[0, sqrt(2)]^3 - 3*[0, sqrt(2)]^2 + 1
  = [0, 2^(5/2)] + [-6, 0] + 1
  = [-5, 1+2^(5/2)] = [-5, 6.6568...]

If we rewrite f = (2r - 3) r^2 + 1
f = (2 [0, sqrt(2)] - 3) [0, sqrt(2)]^2 + 1
  = [-3, -3 + 2^(3/2)] [0, 2] + 1
  = [-5, 1], which is tighter

Other formulations (e.g. mean value form) should give tighter
bounds.

Hope this helps.
