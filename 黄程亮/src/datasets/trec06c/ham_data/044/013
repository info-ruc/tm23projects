>Hi, my name is William Ho.  I just got my new ssc2 few days back.  I have
>connected the ssc2 to HB as everybody does :- Sin (SSC) to digital port 9
>(HB), 9v (HB) power to 9V(SSC), 6V (Battery) to (SSC-servo supply),
>configure SSC to 9600 baud rate (port B of SSC), load pa7i9600.icb (from HB
>serial.html; Inverted TTL-level version), connect servo to servo port 0.
>
>Power on... Until now, I don't know what command shall I type to the c:>. 
>>From the SSC manual, it is 
><225><servo #><position>.  So, shall I type   " 255,0,30; "  or
>servo(255,0,30); ?  I tried all but doesn't work.
>
>Can anyone help me?
>
>Oh, I also loaded servo.icb and servo.c.  Is these necessary or it needs
>add. asm files?
