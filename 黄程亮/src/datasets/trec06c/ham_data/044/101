This is more of a general question about the size and resolution of 
stepper motors and linear actuators.  Basically, I was wondering if 
anyone has any experience with very small high resolution actuators.  I 
am trying to find out if stepper motors on the order of 10 mm in diameter 
with angular resolutions of milliradians exist.  No gear trains would be 
perferable as any backlash is a big problem.  What is the smallest 
angular resolution that people have seen?  I am also looking for very 
tiny linear actuators with about 5cm of travel and micron level 
positioning.  Cost is not really a factor.  Thanks very much for your help.
