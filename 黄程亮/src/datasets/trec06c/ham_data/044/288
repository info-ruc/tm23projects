I'll get flamed for this, but I once dipped a board for an underwater
robot in that liquid plastic stuff. It's at hardware stores, used for
dipping wrench handles and stuff to make them more comfortable and
electrically insulated. I held the board by the powerwires and the
motor/sensor wires in each hand and dipped the whole lot, then pulled it
back out. I'll tell you one thing, it was sealed *well!*

Unfortunately, if you have to change anything your screwed, and you'd
better make sure that the power is always connected to ground, cause you
can get some wierd ESD problems.
