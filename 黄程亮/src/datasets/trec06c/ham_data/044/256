Sergei,

There are a number of variants of branch and bound algorithms that
have appeared in the literature, featured in books by Moore,
Ratschek and Rokne, and Hansen, as well as in numerous papers.  There
are also numerous proofs of convergence.  The details depend on the
specific algorithm.  Facts related to such proofs appear in books
by Alefeld, Neumaier, and elsewhere.  

In my own work, the book "Rigorous Global Search: Continuous Problems,"
does not contain a convergence proof for an overall algorithm, but gives
numerous references.  In earlier work, I gave a general proof in
"Abstract Generalized Bisection and a Cost Bound," Math. Comp. 49 (179),
pp. 187-202 (1987).

For details, I suggest you check the interval bibliography at

Also, please contact me again if you need additional details.

Best regards,

Baker
