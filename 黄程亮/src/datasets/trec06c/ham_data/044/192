Hi,

I am new to this and am in need of some help ~ I have a project due in school 
that requires the use of a 6811 microprocessor ~ and controlled by assembly 
language ~ I have no problem with the hardware ~ the assembly langage ~ or 
the understaning of the "general" layout of the handy-board.

But I am haveing a hard time location the memory location to send controls to 
the outputs to control the motors ~ I found this on a site listed in a 
responce to a stepper motor question ~ it explains what value to send to turn 
on and to sellect the specific motor:

7   Channel 3 enable   128 
6   Channel 2 enable    64 
5   Channel 1 enable    32 
4   Channel 0 enable    16 
3   Channel 3 direction  8 
2   Channel 2 direction  4 
1   Channel 1 direction  2 
0   Channel 0 direction  1 

But please excuse my lack of knowledge ~ What memory address do I send these 
values too???????

Also ~ in my project I need to access the value from a IR sensor I have 
purchased ~ it returns a 0 for an object detected and an 1 for no object 
detected ~ What memory location can I read this from ~ I need 2 inputs and 
can minuplate them useing logical shift right or left to stripp off the 
unwanted buits and do a evaluation of that bit fronm there for the  2 inputs 
~ on the handy baord there is a set of headers labled 10 to 15 for digital 
inputs ~ what is the memory location of these 6 inputs???

Thank You,

Lost newbee ~ lol

Steve
