greetings all,

the time has arisen for the periodic unsubscribe reminder.

1.  to unsubscribe from the Handy Board mailing list, send a request to 
Fred Martin, fredm@media.mit.edu.

2.  Word has it that the one person who can actually take you OFF the 
Handy Board mailing list the same person who put you on.  That person is 
Fred Martin, fredm@media.mit.edu.

3.  Writing to the whole entire list with an unsubscribe request is rude 
and annoying.  Did you know that there is this guy, the guy who runs the 
list, that can take you off?  He is Fred Martin, fredm@media.mit.edu.

This message brought to you courtesy of Fred Martin, fredm@media.mit.edu.

Fred
