...I'm afraid it's not.  There is no such thing as "email tracking" or
"email tracing", despite several emails I've recently received to the
contrary.  Please take a look at the following:

http://urbanlegends.miningco.com/library/weekly/mcurrent.htm?pid=2733&cob=home
http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html
http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACChainLetters.html

In fact, http://ciac.llnl.gov/ is an excellent resource in general for
information about viruses, chain letters, warnings, and the like, and what
you should do about them.  Their warnings are from computer professionals
and verifiable directly or through means of encryption keys, such as PGP.
http://urbanlegends.miningco.com/ is less technical, but still an
accurate, verifiable clearinghouse of information.

In general, if there is no way to verify a warning or request that you
receive, it should not be forwarded or heeded.

Thank you, and have a good day.

[btw, this is the second copy of this note I've mailed out today, and this
is the second email I've received from wrl@anti-social.com (through a
mailing list of which sie is not a member) in the past two days; the first
was an unsolicited advertisement.  Will the person at that address please
not send us anything further unless it is on-topic for the list.  Thanks.]
