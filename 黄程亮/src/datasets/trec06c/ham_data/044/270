I have encountered of all things a gas grill which is controlled by a
microcontroller of unknown origins.  This contoller has bit the bullet
and the grill vendor no longer supports it b/c they are out of business.

The controller has 7 digital user inputs, an analog input for a
millivolt output thermocouple, a digital output for an igniter, a 1 x 16 LCD 
display, and a digital output for the gas valve.

I would like to replace this controller if possible, but I am uncertain
of the reliability of current microcontrollers in an outdoor condensing
environment.  The original board was encased within epoxy and is
unidentifiable as a result.  Heat damage is also visible on the epoxy.

Any suggestions?  Anything would be appreciated at this point.

Thanks,

Jimmie
