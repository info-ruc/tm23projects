Hi,

In the process of sending announcements for CP99, we have set up
a mailing list (CPWORLD@gmu.edu) and have initially signed you up
to the list. The purpose of this list is to disseminate information
pertaining to research in constraint programming. We hope it will
continue its useful life even after CP99, and hope this list
will be beneficial to the entire CP community.

The first announcement will be a Call for Proposal for workshops
for CP99.

The list's owners are Sean Wang (xywang@gmu.edu) and
Alex Brodsky (brodsky@gmu.edu).

You should contact them if there are any problems.

Please do not send requests to this list; instead direct them to:

                        listproc@gmu.edu

To get more information on how to use this service, please send the command
HELP in a line by itself in a mail message to listproc@gmu.edu.

To signoff from the list, email to listproc@gmu.edu with the following
request
in the body of the message:

                signoff CPWORLD
or
                unsubscribe CPWORLD

To send a message to the list, simply send to cpworld@gmu.edu
However, since this list contains a large number of addresses,
please REFRAIN FROM USING THE LIST unless it is clearly beneficial
to the community as a whole. We appreciate your understanding.
If you are not sure if a message should be sent to the list directly,
you may always contact the owners of the list.

To sign on to the mailing list, please send a message to listproc@gmu.edu
with the following request in the body of the message:

subscribe CPWORLD email_address Full name

Thanks.
--Sean Wang and Alex Brodsky
