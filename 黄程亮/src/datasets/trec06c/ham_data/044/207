                              CP99
  Fifth International Conference on Principles and Practice of
                     Constraint Programming

         Call For CP99 Post-Conference Workshop Proposals

Constraints have emerged as the basis of a representational and
computational paradigm that draws from many disciplines and can be
brought to bear on many problem domains.  The Fifth International
Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP99)
will be held on October 11-15, 1999 at Alexandra, Virginia, USA and is
the main conference devoted to all aspects of computing with constraints
including: algorithms, applications, environments, languages, models,
systems.  In conjunction with the main conference, several post-conference
workshops are planned at the end of the conference on October 16, 1999.

The role of the post-conference workshops is to provide a platform
for the presentation of preliminary work or novel ideas in a less
formal way than the conference itself.  It is an opportunity to
disseminate work in progress, particularly so for new researchers.
It also provides a venue for presenting more specialised topics and
opportunities for more intensive discussions and exchange of ideas.
The topics of the workshops can cover any area related to constraints
and any related cross-disciplinary areas.

The format of the workshop will be determined by the organizers.
Workshops can vary in length with an expected duration ranging from
half a day up to one day.  Having two or three co-organizers for a
workshop is strongly advised.

How to Propose a Workshop:
--------------------------

Proposals for workshops should be in English and between two to four pages
in length. They should contain:

  * the title of the workshop
  * a brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop
  * a discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop
  * the names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page, phone,
    fax, etc) of the workshop organizing committee together with a
    designated contact person as the workshop coordinator
  * a preliminary plan/schedule for organizing the workshop
  * a list of previously-organized related workshops by any of the
    workshop organizing committee. Although previous experience with
    organizing similar workshops is not required, this information will
    be helpful to the Workshop Chair

Workshop organizers will be responsible for:

  * Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
    on the net and/or other means. Please provide a web page/URL which can
    be linked into the CP99 home page.
  * Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
program.
  * Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
  * Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
organizers
    and the workshop chair.
  * Making the accepted papers available to the workshop participants.

Submission Procedure:

Proposals should be submitted electronically (in ASCII, Ghostscript
compatible Postscript or LaTeX) to the CP99 Workshop Chair, Jimmy Lee,
