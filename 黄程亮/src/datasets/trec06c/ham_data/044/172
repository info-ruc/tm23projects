Hello list,
Beyond the handyboard I have little need for C and I'm not very good at =
it.  Is there any one book that would be of particular value for this =
case?  That is all I want to do is learn enough to program the =
handyboard.  I bought several books and they are so general that I find =
them of little vale.
Thanks in advance,
Bob Bailey
