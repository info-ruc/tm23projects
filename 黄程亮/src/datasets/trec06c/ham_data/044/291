Why would you get flamed? it's just a conformal coating.  they do it a lot
in the military.  It *IS* possible to fix a circuit board that's been
protected in this way; when I was in the Navy one of the schools I went to
was in microminiature electronic repair, and we spent quite a bit of time
removing the coating, repairing the circuit and replacing the coating. (the
rest of the time I spent learning to windsurf, but that's another story...)
