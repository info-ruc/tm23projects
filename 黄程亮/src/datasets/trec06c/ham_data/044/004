Daniel,

You can use the Motorola 34064, I used it in both of the Handyboards I bu=
ild.
***WARNING*** the Motorola 34064 and the Dallas Semiconductor DS1233-10 h=
ave
different pins out. They are both in 3 pin to-92 packages. I don't rememb=
er
which two pins need to be swapped (check the two data sheets). I put a sm=
all
peice of tubing over one of the pins so they did not touch each other.

It was really hard to find this problem after I build the boards without
swapping the pins :-).
