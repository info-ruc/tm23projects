Scott, any 2x16 character display with the 1x14 pinout will work, although
the display may end up oriented the wrong way. ie. away from the HB (if you
see what I mean). The hitachi chip is a standard interface, but some of the
displays have a 2x7 pinout which complicates things slightly. Ben Wirz has
2x16 units for a reasonable price. Check:

www.wirz.com

although your local electronics store will likely have them, too.

   Obtaining the IS1U60 seems to be an ongoing concern. You can get them
from Marshall (www.marshall.com) or use the GP1U5x series, also by Sharp.
Be aware the pinouts *are* different, so check your datasheets.

    The best (cheapest) way of getting parts can depend alot on where you
are. I'm in Canada, so ordering from the US isn't always economical.
