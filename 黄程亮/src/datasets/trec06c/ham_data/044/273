Salt Lake Java SIG - May Meeting
Topic:  Integrated Development Environments for Java
Date & Time:  Tuesday, May 25 1999   7:00 - 8:00 PM
Location:  Room 110, EMCB (Eng.& Mines Classroom Bldg), Univ. Of Utah

We've had a number of vendors come and demonstrate their Integrated
Development Environments for developing Java applets/applications.
Now that some of us have worked with them over the last year or so
- its time to compare notes.  We will discuss our experiences with the
IDEs.  What are their pros and cons?  How do they compare?  Is there
a place for standalone JDK development?  Come and participate in our
roundtable discussion.
