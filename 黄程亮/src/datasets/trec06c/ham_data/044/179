Dear Bob,

I have been using IC for a couple of years, with no prior experience in
C.  IC is a very small subset of C, as I've learned by studying ANSI C
in the last few weeks.  The full bore language is a challenge to learn,
although you can do it on your own with a little discipline and a lot of
time.  However, you can learn IC much more quickly, and since you have
no need of ANSI C, learning it would be a huge waste of time.

You can easily learn IC on your own by using the available resources,
and by getting yourself a copy of "Mobile Robots, From Inspiration to
Implementation."  There are tons of IC examples in that book.  You will
also need to build up a robot using your Handy Board.  You can learn a
lot by just having motors and a couple of bump senors and light
sensors.  The Mobile Robots book has schematics, and the circuits are
easier to do than the hardware.

Other than the Mobile Robots book, there is no other text dealing with
IC that I am aware of.  Fred is working on a book according to his
website, but I'm not sure of the status of that.  Dr. Martin?

Good luck, and let me know if you get stuck on anything or have other
questions.
