Hello,

I have not done anything with my Miniboard for quite some time but I
believe what you are seeing is just the basic lighting due to the fact that
there is nothing programmed.  You need to put it in bootstrap mode and
download the proper files to the processor.  Then when you turn it on you
should see the proper lights turn on.  If I rememeber correctly there are
two buttons just as the HandyBoard has and you need to hold both of them
down when you turn it on to put it in bootstrp mode.  Then you need to
download the proper files to the processor.  Someone correct me if I am
wrong.  Hope this helps.

Scott
