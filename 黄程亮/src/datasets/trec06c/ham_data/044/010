what i am doing is building a battery charger for back-up batteries to be
used with the handyboard, so i don't have to wait for the batteries to
charge. can i use the schematic that i found in the handy board technical
reference manual except exclude the serial interface part of the circuit.
using the pin that connects to the RJ12 jack (pin 4) as the positive
terminal and connect the negative to ground (of the batteries). will this
work? 

FRED
