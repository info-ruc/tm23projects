If you've loaded the pa7i9600 file, you need to use these lines:

 pa7i9600(255);
 pa7i9600(0);
 pa7i9600(127);

which should move servo number 0 to position 127 (the centre position).
Probably better if you use something like 255 or 0 to get it to move to the
extremes. You need to use these lines pretty much one after the other (ie no
other commands in between) for the controller to work.

Hope this helps,
Adam
