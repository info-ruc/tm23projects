Subject: Re: DS1233

I used the Motorola 34064 instead of the Dallas 1233 since one year.
=46unctionaly, It seems to work fine.
Nevertheless, the chip seems warm.
Recently, 2 68hc11 died on my board, apparently without any reason.
I wonder if this is due to the current sink of the 34064.
Has anybody already met this kind of problem ?
