Friends, 

Dr. Abraham Ziv from IBM Israel Science & Technology Ltd. recently developed 
a math library that correctly rounds (to nearest) twelve elementary math
functions for IEEE double precision numbers for use with Java. This is a 
significant research accomplishment, because it allows code with elementary 
functions to produce the same results on different platforms. It also paves
the way for developing elementary math functions with correct rounding for
the other IEEE rounding modes, which would be extremely useful for interval
arithmetic.  

The libary can be downloaded from 
   http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/tech/mathlibrary4java
A copy of Dr. Ziv's original email along with a citation to one of his 
journal articles in this area is given below. 

Regards,

Mike

> I would like to inform you that a correctly rounding (to nearest) math

> The library includes twelve elementary math functions for the IEEE
> arithmetic format 'double'. The functions included are: acos, asin, atan,
> atan2, cos, exp, log, pow, remainder, sin, tan. One may download and try
> the library with any one of the following operating systems: WIN NT (on a
> PENTIUM PC), AIX (on RS/6000), SOLARIS (on SPARC). Your response would be
