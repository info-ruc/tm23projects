Hi all,

I had been under the impression that the Nantasket kite festival was on
sunday this weekend, but it is actually saturday!.  It is being hosted by
Seaside kites and is from around 10am to 5pm.  I will be going down and
would love to see all and sundry who are interested in frollicking at the
beach and flying kites as a celebration of semester's end.

we have some nice new toys to play with including kite to ground video,
musical kites, and anything you wish to bring along.  Looks like the winds
will be good.  Frisbee and football during the breaks in the wind.

If it rains on saturday the event is postponed to sunday.

please let me know if you will be going / will be driving / or need a ride.
If you need help getting your kites in flying order, let me know.

Saul.

it is about a 1/2 hour drive;
