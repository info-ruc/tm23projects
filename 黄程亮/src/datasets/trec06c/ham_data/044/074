Hi Max:

I used your IR routines with the HandyBoard. I was wondering if
it is possible to do something like that for the RUG Warrior, 'cos
it also uses the similar IR receiver ( GP1U52X ) . The port to which 
the sensor is connected is different ( PE4 in Rug Warrior ). I do not
know much assembly language so I was wondering if it is possible and
what all changes need to be made in the code.

Thanks.
