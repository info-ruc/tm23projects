Subject: Correctly-rounding elementary functions for Java
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.927222497.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

Folks, this note on the development of a correctly-rounded elementary
function library for Java may be of interest to those of you who are
involved in numerical programming in Java:

>> Friends, 
>> 
>> Dr. Abraham Ziv from IBM Israel Science & Technology Ltd. recently developed 
>> a math library that correctly rounds (to nearest) twelve elementary math
>> functions for IEEE double precision numbers for use with Java. This is a 
>> significant research accomplishment, because it allows code with elementary 
>> functions to produce the same results on different platforms. It also paves
>> the way for developing elementary math functions with correct rounding for
>> the other IEEE rounding modes, which would be extremely useful for interval
>> arithmetic.  
>> 
>> The libary can be downloaded from 
>>    http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/tech/mathlibrary4java
>> A copy of Dr. Ziv's original email along with a citation to one of his 
>> journal articles in this area is given below.
