My apologies to those smart enough to know better...

Fred Martin must have mailed that unsubscribe reminder to me only. I
remember seeing it just a day ago, but since there are so many people
burning up bandwidth by sending requests to the list, he must have only
sent it to me.

Fred, I am personally volunteering my services as professional jerk. If
you hire me (my fee is a modest nothing per hour), I will privately
berate every individual who sends unsubscribe requests to this list.

Please people, I'm assuming that you are at least a little bit
intelligent (you're at least *interested* in electronics). Don't annoy
the entire list with your stupidity and/or laziness. There are many of
us here who care about things like bandwidth.

READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!
