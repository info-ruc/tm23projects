areas of computer science, artificial intelligence and other
disciplines, both from the academic environment and from public/private
enterprise, who have a common interest in exploring the new employment

point of view, the area offers the typical Lombard architecture, castles
with frescoes, Renaissance villas and many 18th century palaces with
splendid gardens in the Italian style of the period. Consult the
Internet for the site of the Varese province to navigate in four
languages through this interesting area: http://www.provincia.va.it even
before coming to the Symposium.
