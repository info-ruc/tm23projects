please don't send attachments to the mailing list.  a 200 K message sent 
out to 500 people is 100 megs of data.  also some people have small 
mailbox quotas that can be filled up by just one big attachment.  i 
realize 200K isn't huge, but it's still a bit of a problem, especially if 
it became a regular practice.

if you have something you'd like to share, the best way is to put it up 
on a web site and send around the url.  if you don't have a web server 
you can readily use, contact me and often i'm willing to host a useful 
bit of info on the HB site.

thanks for your attention.

fred
