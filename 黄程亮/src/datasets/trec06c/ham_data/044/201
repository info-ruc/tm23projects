HI, I just have a few questions for the experts, approximately how 
many lines of code can the handyboards memory hold? I want to know so 
I have a scope of how big a program can be written to it.  Also I 
read in the mobile robotics book  that it is possible to interface 
 another 32k memory chip using existing lines and an inverter on the 
CE line. is this possible on the handyboard? and if it is would it be 
a good idea?

Thank you in advance
