Hi! im building the handy board interface with a friend. Both of us live
in mexico city and we have not found some parts like the ztx614
transistor darlington arrangement, we would like to know which is the
gain of each transistor in this arrangement to buil it. 
Do you know some substitute for the RUE250 poliswitch or some way to
build one?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Atte.Eduardo Gonzalez Ramirez
