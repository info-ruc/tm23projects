Dear Fred:
I am having problems driving stepping motors off the handyboard. I have
not found much on steppers and handy board except for the code found on
Peter Harrison's page, but I cannot get it to work with IC 3.1. Can you
tell me where I can find some good tested examples? Thanks for
help.Regards
Marco
