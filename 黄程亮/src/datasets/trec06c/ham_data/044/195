FASE 2000

To achieve the status of a proper engineering discipline, Software 
Engineering requires engineering design and analysis METHODS which are 
firmly grounded on scientifically sound concepts as well as well founded 
software tools and analyses based on sound engineering principles. 
Fundamental approaches are sought, integrating formal approaches with 
principled methods, providing the bridge between theory and practice and 
aimed at producing engineering methods and tools for the various phases of 
software development. FASE is intended to provide a forum where fundamental
approaches to Software Engineering are presented, compared and discussed. 
Contributions should focus on the problems and methods of Software 
engineering; papers are especially welcome on the following topics: 

- Methods for the design of high quality software, relying on formal 
  approaches tospecification, refinement, testing and validation
- The use of program derivation and transformation methods to support 
  software production 
- Integration of formal notations and methods with engineering notations
  and methods  
- Combining programming in the small and programming in the large; 
- design of software architectures  
- Principled approaches to reverse engineering, legacy software, reuse and 
  evolution 
- Case studies of the application of principled Software Engineering methods
- Reports evaluating industrial experience of the use of Software Engineering
  methods 
- Rigorous experimental studies of the effectiveness and applicability of 
  principled methods

FOSSACS 2000

FOSSACS seeks papers which offer progress in foundational research with 
a clear significance for software science. A central issue is theories 
and methods which support the specification, transformation, verification, 
and analysis of programs and software systems. Topics covered are: 

- Computational and syntactic foundations of software science: computation 
  processes overdiscrete and continuous data, techniques for their 
  manipulation, and their algorithmic, algebraic, and logical properties; 
- Transition systems, models of concurrency and reactive systems, and 
  corresponding calculi, algebras, and logics; 
- Type theory, domain theory, and their connections to semantics

TACAS 2000

TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in 
rigorously based tools for the construction and analysis of systems. 
The conference serves to bridge the gaps between different communities --- 
including but not limited to those devoted to formal methods, real-time, 
software engineering, communications protocols, hardware, theorem proving, 
and programming languages --- that have traditionally had little interaction 
but share common interests in, and techniques for,tool development. In 
particular, by providing a venue for the discussion of common problems, 
heuristics, algorithms, data structures and methodologies, TACAS aims to 
support researchers in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, 
flexibility and efficiency of TOOLs for building systems.  Tool descriptions 
and case studies with a conceptual message and theoretical papers with a 
clearlink to tool construction are particularily encouraged. The specific 
topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the 
following. 

- verification and construction techniques; 
- compositional and refinement-based methodologies;  
- test generation; 
- theorem-proving and model checking;  
- analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid and safety-critical systems;
- tool environments and tool architectures;  
- applications and case studies.  

All accepted contributions will receive the same space in the conference 
schedule and in the proceedings, and technical support will be provided for 
allowing presenters to demonstrate their tools during their talks. Facilities 
will also be available for informal tool demonstrations during the conference.
As TACAS addresses a heterogeneous audience, potential authors are strongly 
encouraged to write about their ideas in general and jargon-independent, 
rather than application-and domain-specific, terms.

Tutorials

Proposals for half-day or full-day tutorials related to ETAPS 2000 are 
invited. Tutorial proposals will be evaluated on the basis of their 
assessed benefit for prospective participants to ETAPS 2000. Submissions 
are to be in the form of a proposal of maximum 10 pages for review purposes.
Proposals should include a description of the material that will be covered 
in the tutorial; a justification of the relevance ofthe tutorial for 
ETAPS 2000; a short history of the tutorial in the event it has been given 
before; duration of the tutorial; scope of the tutorial; the key learning 
objectives for the participants; the intended audience for the tutorial and 
required background; andthe credentials of the instructor(s). 

Submissions should be sent by October 18, 1999, preferably electronically 
(plain text or uuencoded gzipped Postscript), to:

Tool Demonstrations

Demonstrations of tools presenting advances on the state of the art are 
invited. Submissions in this category should present tools having a clear 
connection to one of the main ETAPS conferences, possibly complementing a 
paper submitted separately. Submissions in this category should not be
confused with contributions to TACAS, which emphasizes principles of tool 
design, implementation, and use, rather than focusing on specific domains 
of application. Tool demonstrations will be presented in devoted conference 
sessions with state-of-the-art projection facilities. Authors of accepted 
demos will be asked to contribute a short paper to the proceedings of the 
relevant ETAPS conference. 

Submissions should take the form of a tool description of no more than 4 
pages in theSpringer-Verlag LNCS format. The ETAPS conference within whose 
purview the tool falls should be clearly indicated on the title page. At 
least one screen snapshot should be provided to allow the selection committee
to get some impression of the quality of the user interface. A specification
of the hardware and software requirements for installing and demonstrating 
the tool must be provided.Screen snapshots and the hardware/software 
specification are not included in the page limit unless they constitute part 
of the description of the tool.
