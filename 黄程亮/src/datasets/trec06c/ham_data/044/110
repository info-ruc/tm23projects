can we please all make a deal to stop replying to this list, i know that
i am only exacerbating the predicament , but i am trying to stop the
insanity as they say.
no one knows who started this, but i have a suspicion based on teh
addresses which are getting bounced and so on, it was probably inside
Columbia.  at any rate, this list has become a self perpetuating demon
and the more we all reply to it the worse it gets.  so lets make this the
last of it all and everyone delete any trace of this nonsense from there
mailboxes.
and most of all
have a good weekend
