Hello all,

	I modified my HB to except the external motor source.  After downloading a
test program to see if all the ports worked, I found that only one motor
port now works.  There is the possibility that I shorted out other chips,
but I am sure that I did not connect the power in backwards.  I have tried
replace the H-Bridge chips (the TI one's) with no more success in solving my
problem.  Has anyone else seen this before and know of a solution?  What
other chips should I be checking if the motor ports do not work?  Thanks for
any advice!!!

	Bill Denzel
