I have constructed an Excel file that is useful for building .rtf files.
It is mainly aimed at masked priming experiments, but once you see how it
is done, you could easily adapt it for your own purposes.

One nice application is for students who need to use DMDX for an
experiment, but don't need to have all the intricacies of .rtf files
explained to them.  You could set up a file so that all they had to was a
bit of cut and pasting, and the .rtf file is automatically generated.

The example file is available at:
