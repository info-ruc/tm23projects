They keep falling down:-)

Sorry, couldn't resist that.  Check out the MIT site.  They have a good robotics 
department.  I don't know if it was MIT or not but I say a robot that was 
developed at one of these institutions that was one-legged and could do flips 
and still maintain balance.

Maybe someone knows the link to that one.
