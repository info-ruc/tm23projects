I too have done this, with both a Garmin GPS-II+ and a Garmin GPS-35PC.  I
have posted segments of the code necessary to do this to the Handyboard
list before, so if you look through the archives and grep for "WE7U", you
should find them.  If you can't, let me know and I can look for my copy of
the message.

John:  I would be interested in seeing your code, for the reason that I
have written a nice Perl program that will display GPS data in real-time,
and was trying at one time to get support working for a Tripmate as well.
The Tripmate that I borrowed had to go back to the owner too quick before
I had it all working.  I works very nicely with any Garmin GPS that I've
tried it with, but of course the Tripmate needs a special sentence sent to
it, and the handshaking has to be right (I needed to wire a special
adapter to pass DTR through, and didn't get around to doing that).
