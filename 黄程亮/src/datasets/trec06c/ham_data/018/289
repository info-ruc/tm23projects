Finally I managed to put the schematic of Wind-O-meter described in the
Elektor publication in ASCII.  Pl. set your reader font to something
like courier to view it properly.  I have taken some liberty with the
opamp symbol to accomodate some component connections.

M is a 50 mA meter (collector of T1).  Opamp supply connections not
shown.
T1 and T2 are maintained in good thermal contact by glueing them
together using a heat conductive adhesive.  This pair is used as the
probe to check wind speed/air leaks.  T2 is maintained at a constant
temperature by the opamp and T1.  When wind/leak is present, the pair is
cooled - more current has to flow through T1 to maintain the temp.  This
current is indicated by the meter. T3 acts as a reference diode.

The description says - A high sensitivity is obtained by making the
temp. of T2 about 5 degrees higher than its surroundings. This is
achieved by presetting the meter to give an offset of about 5 mA when
there is no wind blowing. BC 639 can be replaced by a BC 547 type. R1 is
selected so that the current through T1 is not excessive. Hope this
helps.
