Subject: Windows NT experiences?

Hi all, I was wondering if people would please "share" their experiences
running Interactive C on Windows NT.  Is anyone using the old freeware
DOS IC on NT?  Did you have any trouble getting it to work?

Please send to the list, or me privately if you'd rather not.  

Thanks,
Fred
