Could someone tell me how to use the
hog_processor(). I want to dedicate the
controller to only one task. I tried the following
program but it did not go faster than 700HZ.
void main()
  {   =

   while(1)
    {      =

     hog_processor();
      v_opt =3D analog(0);   /*measure optical sensor */
      poke(0x6fff,v_opt);     /* A/D correction */
    }  /* end of while */
    }  /* end of main program*/

Thank you in advance.
