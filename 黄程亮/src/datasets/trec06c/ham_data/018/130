yep, 5 kHz is about the top end of the HB's 6811 capability.  going
higher would require dedicating the 'hc11 to generating the tone and
doing nothing else.

why?  interrupt routine overhead.  takes a bunch of cycles to handle
an interrupt.  the tone function uses the interrupt so it normally
doesn't have to hog the CPU.  

if you hog the CPU, you can go up to 100khz or so...
