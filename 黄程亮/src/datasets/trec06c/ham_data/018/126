When pcode is downloaded to the Handy Board, how much memory space does i=
t take up?

I am a little concerned about having enough memory space for my programs.=
 As I see it now, I think I may max out the 32KB.=20

Does anyone have tips on how to concerve space. The only thing I can thin=
k of is to edit out some functions from lib_hb.c that I am not using, and=
 also not loading the r22 IR files which I'm not using either.

(I think someone posted once about a similar problem and said that some s=
pace concerving was solved after using the commericial version of IC, how=
 so?)

Is it possible to expand the memory, or is 32 KB the most I can work with=
?

Thanks in advance,
