make sure you get FEMALE header for the HB itself.   The only male
header is for the LCD, to plug it into its female socket on the HB.

It looks like the ED72xx parts are MALE.  You probably want ED71xx for
female.  Please note I haven't ordered ED7xxx components before, so
I'm not absolutely sure they're right, but they look right from the
cat page.
