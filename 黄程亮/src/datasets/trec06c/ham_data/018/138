The 0x0C value represents EEPROM OFF, ROM OFF.

A related question that I have is that I'm using the 811E2 and the hbdl program 
will only work if I use 0xFF.  Which places EEPROM ON and at the upper 
most locations.

Also, IC seems to work fine.  What will NOT work?  And what is the likelyhood 
that IC will stop working?

Does anyone know of a workaround that will allow me to use IC and be able to 
turn off the 811E2 EEPROM?   HBDL will only work with the 811E2 if I use FF 
as the configuration register value.

I have been having problems finding the A1FN for some reason.  I have tried all 
the likely sources and everyone seems to be back ordered.  I however have 
many of the 811E2s and a couple of other EEPROM varities.
