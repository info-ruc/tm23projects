Dear all,

The design for the Handy Board Expansion Board is done, and I am now
sponsoring a limited beta-test program.

I know that many of you have been waiting a long time for the board,
and I will be asking most of you to wait a little longer as the beta
test is performed, but I think you will be happy with the results.

The most-requested features, including nine digital outputs and six
servo motor outputs, have been incorporated into the new design.

For more information on the design, see

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30b/

If you would like to participate in the beta-test program, see

I am anticipating the final design will be available at the end of the
summer.

Yours,
Fred
