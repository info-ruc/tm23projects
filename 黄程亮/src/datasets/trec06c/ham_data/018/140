I just found out about a Canadian supplier of hobby robotics in Canada.

http://www.hvwtech.com

They have robot kits, some good looking gearboxes (for those who have
wrestled with making their own), L293 and L298 motor driver kits and 
other robotics goodies.  

This is of special interest for Canadians, of course (save duty etc.) 
but may be a useful resource to our friends overseas and south of the 
border.

Cheers, Skye.

(Fear not, I am in *no* way related to this operation!)
