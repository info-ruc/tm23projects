Hi all,

I got a number of replies to the expansion board beta test program on
sunday night and monday, but just one yesterday, so:

	      I'm moving up the closing to this friday.

If you're interested and you haven't contacted me yet, please do so by
then, but only after reading through the information at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30b/betatest.html

thanks everyone,
fred
