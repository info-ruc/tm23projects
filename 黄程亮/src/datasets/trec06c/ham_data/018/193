I'll have to check this out.  We havn't actually used hot-wire-anemometers
recently, partly because we havn't had the need, and partly because
vortex-shedding flowmeters are all the rage right now.  My memory is they
are not linear, but that the curve is second order and easy to handle.
Temperature, density, and heat content of the medium are a big problem, but
if these don't vary much...
They ARE small. And fragile.  I replaced one once by crushing a flashlight
bulb, recovering the filament mount and soldering the platinum wire in place
of the filament.  Under a microscope.  Don't sneeze.
