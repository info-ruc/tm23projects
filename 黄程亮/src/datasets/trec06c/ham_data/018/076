Where is your source and how do the Cirrus compare to Futuba in price?

At a local hobby store in Houston I bought 2 Futuba 3003 (I think) that are
the replacements for the 148 which I believe are no longer being made. They
cost me about $13 but list was about $20. The Hitec models were a couple of
dollars more expensive. The Cirrus seems to be faster since the Futuba was .23
sec for 60 degrees at 4.8V.
