the motor is available via LEGO Shop at Home (S@H for short)
tel: 1-800-453-4652

there are three kind of motors:
#5114    $17.50 (the one that you see in #8270, old style)
#5225    $17.50 (the one that in #8735, newer one, with gear reduction)
#5119    $11.00 (micro motor, the one in set #8480 to open the satellite
wings)

the other source for LEGO motor is PITSCOm they carry the LEGO DACTA
products
tel: 1-800-362-4308

the part number:
#775114    $24.50 (#5114)
#775225    $24.50 (#5225)
#775119    $23.00 (#5119)

here is a scan of the parts from PITSCO
http://www.ee.nmt.edu/~jmathis/dacta.html
(this is NOT my webpage)

so, it is cheaper to buy it from LEGO S@H, and you don't have to pay
shipping if buying from S@H
but, PITSCO carry some very neat parts which are not available from S@H,
such as the large turntable (the one you see in set #8460, #8459, btw, the
part# is 779876, 2 for $9.50 + shipping) and converyor belt links.
PITSCO also have some sensors, such as light sensors, touch sensors,
temperature sensors and angle sensors. I was wondering, does anybody ever
use the angle sensors? it seem to be a fun one to play with...
hope that helps
Sterling
