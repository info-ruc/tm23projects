We have used model boat propellers on a ballbearing and on a brass bushing.
Keep the bearing or bushing well lubricated for good sensitivity at low
air volume (ie: low speed of the propeller).

We used the propeller mounted in 1.5 inch and 2 inch PVC black plumbing pipe.
Optical encoder replaced an optical diode pair which the three blade 
propeller tips moved through.
