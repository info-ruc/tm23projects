Subject: Cheap air flow sensor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Does anyone know of a cheap way to construct an air flow sensor? I was
looking for an article in EDN  on using a self-heated transistor to measure
airflow, but  Ican't find it.

I was also wanting to know if there is a way to create a humidity sensor,
or does anyone know of a low cost part?

I am wanting to connect these to a miniboard.

Thanks
