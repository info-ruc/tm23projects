Subject: Re: any micromice out there?

Hi Brian,

    Several of my Penn State Abington freshman and sophomore engineering
students constructed a working micromouse from LEGO and a HB. The approach
was a vehicle that can only move in the north-south or east-west directions
by alternately lowering and raising sets of powered wheels using a servo
motor. (The same approach was used in a successful fire-fighting robot.)
The robot uses 2, 9-volt LEGO motors, IR sensors from Radio Shack for
wall-sensing, and is programmed in IC ( 500+ LOC).

     The micromouse earned second place in a MM contest sponsored by the
Phila. IEEE section held at Drexel University this past March '98. Only 3
teams participated, but we were the only team with a home-built MM, the
other schools in the area purchased "Mappy" robots from Japan which need be
programmed in assembly language. =20

    The first version of the LEGO/HB robot for the 1997 MM contest was
designed, constructed, and programmed in less than 2 weeks (including 1 week
of Spring break) -- that's dedication.  Unfortunately, a program bug
surfaced during the '97 contest.  Our robot is currently slow, but it was
successful in solving the maze, and we hope to make some s/w changes to
speed up execution time and improve the search technique.

   Due to the small size of a MM, the students found it very challenging to
build a frame from LEGO -- but it certainly can be done. We did not have the
time to explore many alternate approaches.  The students maxed out the
memory space on the HB at one point, but there is much room for improvements
in efficiency -- the HB met the challenge.  Some of our "out of memory"
problems seemed to disappear with IC3.2.  Software for a MM can be quite
complex.

  When I get a chance I will post pictures and s/w of the MM robot, along
with robots from our other contests.

Good luck.
