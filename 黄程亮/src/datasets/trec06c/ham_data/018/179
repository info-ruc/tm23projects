Hi, I wonder if this is a little off topic, but since I got a Handyboard
I would like to use it in a walking robot application. Does anyone have
any experience in making 2-legged robots? Hmm....


Umm...and a message for Fred....my email has changed from
smwong@post1.com to siming@singnet.com.sg ...please update it, thanks!
