Subject: Handy Board Header
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


I'm trying to order the handy board headers (J3-4, J6-8, etc).  I've got a
digi-key part number of
ED72xx-ND  where xx is the number of pins for the female.  Is this correct?

There seems to be a wide varity on the male J15, does someone have a part
number or dimensions?

The photo of J6 the 4x2 header looks like 2 rows of singles, is this right?

Thanks
