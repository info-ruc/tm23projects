  I'm pretty sure that since the Handy Board also uses TOC4 as its system 
interrupt, that it takes care of clearing the interrupt.  My code just gets linked in 
and gets executed before the Handy Board code (though I don't know what the 
HB code does exactly).  Besides, it doesn't lock up the system -- it just gives 
incorrect (but consistent) results.  Also, in the small example code in the Handy 
Board manual, which uses this same interrupt to drive the beeper at 1000Hz, I 
don't remember them clearing or setting any interrupts either. Is my assumption 
wrong?
  I'm beginning to think that maybe its a problem with the decoder itself -- I may 
just be reading it too fast.  I'll try to slow it down various ways today (even 
though I've already tried that to some extent) to see if I can get around the 
problem.  I may also try using different interrupts and see what happens.

  Thanks for the help.
