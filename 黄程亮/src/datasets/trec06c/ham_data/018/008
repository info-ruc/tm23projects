Hello,
	I've been trying to compile  .asm files using as11.exe.  The files I
received with my copy of IC contain the #include directive.  Does anyone
know of a copy of as11.exe that supports this?  If I use as11_ic.bat, to
build an *.icb file, the gcc compiler says that it can't find the include
files, even when I specify the full path.  Why is this?
	Secondly, I am trying to get HexMon to run on my HandyBoard.  It seems to
download correctly,  but is there a quick way to test that it is running
correctly.  Ultimately I want to get the MB_Test program to interface with
it, but it just hangs for now.

Thanks,
	Aaron Edsinger
