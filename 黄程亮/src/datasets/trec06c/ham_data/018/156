I have a couple of nice motors that I would like to get some info on.  They were
removed from some medical recording devices.  They are very small and have
pretty good power.  If you try to stop the motor by grabbing the bushing on the 
shaft, it is very difficult.

Anyway, they don't have a brand but have the following markings.

escap (R) E16
64,1:1

swiss made
TC 11 205 0

They are about 1.9" long and .65" in diameter.  Anyone know how I can get 
some spec. on these?
