Mike,
	I have actually seen only 3 reasonable quality walkers on the market
(the 6 legged kind) but I have to admit that I haven't searched that far
recently. Lynxmotion (http://www.lynxmotion.com) do one which looks to
be pretty good quality however it is a bit expensive, it also requires
12 servos. Novasoft (http://www.mil.ufl.edu/novasoft/) also do a 12
servo, 6 legged walker which is a different design from the Lynxmotion
one but still looks pretty good. The final one is the Stampbug, this is
a 3 servo, 6 legged walker from Parallax (http://www.parallaxinc.com/)
which is fairly restricted in it's development but is a simple starting
point (it is driven by either a pic or Basic stamp1 but the servos can
be controlled from any source as long as it isn't to heavy, the stampbug
is quite small).
Hope this helps.

John Hatton
