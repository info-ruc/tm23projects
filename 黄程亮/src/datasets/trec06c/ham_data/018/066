the problem that i was having with the onboard IR receiver is that the codes
that i retrieved from the ir_data() function were inconsistant from the same
remote control button.  the error was usually manifested in multiples of two,
which lead me to believe that the data coming in has been logically
(arithmetically) shifted.  this was probably due to the first and sometimes
second incoming bit being missed.  however, i developed a way to eliminate
this problem about 99% of the time.  this is by turning the software driver on
and off, by using the sony_init() function.  in my tests, the receiver
responds much better than before, however, it does not poll continuosly.  i
thought that maybe the HB could be tricked into polling continuosly, maybe
this will lead you in the right direction.
