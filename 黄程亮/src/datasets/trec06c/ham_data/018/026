Subject: clock signal needed for decoder chip
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

I am hooking some HP decoder chips to the handyboard.  They are
HCTL-2020's and they decode a motor position encoder signal.  My problem
is that I need to hook one of the pins on the 2020 (the CLK pin) to a
clock.  I'd like to get ahold of the E pin on the microprossesor but I
don't know where I can get that output on the handyboard.  My only other
option is to build my own clock.

Help appreciated.
Thanks,
Chad
