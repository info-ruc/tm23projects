Subject: Freewawre IC Error
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

	I just got my hands on a beautiful old monster of an AT PC (Cost=$0).  I
figured, why not transfer IC over to that computer, and use it in my
workshop instead of programming the 'board on our main computer and then
bringing it down to the basement.  The PC downloaded fine using dl.exe, and
all that.  I reconfingured (Freeware) IC, and then when I ran it, I got
this error (after it synchronized with the board and right before it
finished loading lib_hb.c by default):
	run-time error M6107: MATH
	 ~floating-point error: unemulated

Does that mean I need a math coprocessor in order to load things into the
HB?  I tried not loading the libs by default, and I synchronized the board
and got all the way to the "C>" prompt.  From there, I can communicate with
the board and do math etc.  Please tell me fixes, bad news, etc.
