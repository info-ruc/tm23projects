elivering voice, data and video services. Broadband TV (IPTV), Digital and=

This report examines the global Digital Media market, including in-depth a=
nalyses of the market and the various trends and developments. It also exa=
mines the Triple Play business models, convergence, media centres for the =
digital home and the content and media markets. It includes market overvie=
ws and statistics for Digital pay TV, Digital terrestrial TV, Interactive =
TV, Broadband TV, Mobile TV, DVR/PVRs, and HDTV and datacasting.  =20
  =20
Key Highlights:  =20
- The media market is on the verge of massive changes driven by new develo=
pments in broadband technology and consumer electronics.   =20
- The consumer electronics market is pushing for changes driven by plasma =
screens and DVRs; thus increasing market demand for more and better entert=
ainment services. This industry will continue to profit from new developme=
nts in 2006.   =20
- The cable industry is another access technology in the converging market=
s of telecommunications, broadcasting, Internet and e-commerce.   =20
- New digital-based broadcasters are rapidly moving into the areas of broa=
dband and telecommunications. Broadband TV (IPTV) could double the amount =
of revenue from the top 25% users of high speed broadband.   =20
- By 2008, we expect video streaming technology to be mainstream and fully=
 integrated into any broadband service.   =20
- Changes in the telecommunication and media markets are being forced upon=
 the industry by the new emerging Internet companies such as Google, eBay/=
Skype, Yahoo!, Vonage, AOL, MSN, News Ltd and Amazon. They are breaking do=
wn the old business models in the industry which are mainly built around m=
onopolistic market structures.   =20
At the heart of a digital home is the technical concept known as the Media=
 Centre. By 2015 90% of all households in the developed market will have a=
 home media centre.   =20
Cable TV operators, telcos, consumer electronics and IT companies are all =
vying for the Media Centre business. Progress in this market will continue=
 to evolve with more mass market developments expected from 2008 onwards. =
  =20
- Despite some governments mandating digital TV in its various forms, ther=
e is little evidence of a rush by consumers to buy it. Instead they are mo=
re interested in new services such as provided by Internet, online service=
s, pay-per-view and on-demand services.   =20
- Cable and satellite TV services are rapidly becoming digital. Digital Te=
rrestrial TV has been slower to make progress due to a lack of global stan=
dards.   =20
- In 2005, we estimate there were around 350 million cable TV subscriber h=
ouseholds worldwide.   =20
- Video-based services on broadband and interactive digital TV networks ar=
e becoming whole new areas for advertising opportunities. Personalised med=
ia and one-to-one communication will be the predominant advertising mode u=
sing Digital Media.   =20
We expect the global market for VoD to grow to over 350 million households=
 by 2010.   =20
SMS took the world by surprise and Mobile TV is following in its footsteps=
 It combines two of the most widespread communication media. It is becomi=
ng available in selected markets during 2006 and will reach mass market by=
 2008.   =20
- The development of broadband has seen the implementation of interactive =
TV initiatives. The UK is a leader in this market, with the BBC arguably t=
he best iTV broadcaster in the world. We predict that interactive TV and o=
ther enhanced television products will generate billions of dollars in adv=
ertising and commerce worldwide.   =20
Nextgen DSL based broadband networks based on IP are now rapidly moving in=
to triple play business models, delivering voice, data and video services;=
 DSL TV is one of the new emerging disruptive technologies.   =20
- In a converged telecommunication and media environment, the focus will m=
ove toward content and applications, and this will require a change in mar=
keting strategies. Telcos, ISPs and BSPs must move on from their techno dr=
iven approach.   =20
- Branding has always been an essential element of the industry=27s market=
ing strategies, and this needs to be linked to a value proposition.   =20
- For those needing high level strategic information and objective analysi=
s, this report is essential reading.  =20
