Neat idea! It reminds me of a simple variometer (rate of climb/sink) 
circuit in an old RC glider magazine. It used two small naked bead or 
glass encapsulated thermistors  in a bridge circuit and the 
thermistors were in a tube connected to a bottle. As the air pressure 
changed and air flowed in or out,  the "up wind" one  cooled more 
than the "down wind" one in its wind shadow and any "common 
mode" temperature changes cancelled. Again the current was set to 
give the appropriate self heating. Very similar to what you describe.

        Regards,
            Graeme
