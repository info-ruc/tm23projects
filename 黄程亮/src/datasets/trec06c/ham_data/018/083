IO VOLCANO NEWS

New observations by Bob Howell, Christophe Dumas, and John Stansberry
suggest increasing activity at Loki:

In late May and early June Jupiter occultation and eclipse observations
of Io were obtained at WIRO by Bob Howell and Coralie Crumrine that
indicate increased activity on the Jupiter facing hemisphere.  This may
be the beginning of another "brightening" of Loki. 

The Jupiter occultation data on May 27 and June 3 show three significant
sources called A, B, and C in the following.  The occultation data only
determine a position along an arc representing the limb of Jupiter, but
source A is probably Kanehekili, B may be Ra, and C is probably Loki.
The following table gives the disappearance times and the fluxes, as
measured in a filter centered at 3.44 microns. 

         May 27     June 3         May 27   June 3

           UT          UT              GW/um/str
  A    13:10:23.1  15:06:53.1      8.1     8.1
  B    13:12:20.5  15:08:50.8      7.5     6.1
  C    13:12:53.6  15:09:26.1     16.5    22.7

The May 27 occultation lightcurve is available at
<ftp://goshawk.uwyo.edu/outgoing/io/980527/lightcurve.ps>.  A map
showing the position of the Jupiter limb at the disappearance times (and
therefore the possible hot spot locations) is available at
<ftp://goshawk.uwyo.edu/outgoing/io/980527/iomap.gif>.  The solid lines
are for May 27 and the dashed ones are for June 3.  The cross marks the
position of Kanehekili.  All of the arcs pass slightly west (on Io) of
the above named hot spots, but this seems to be due to a 6 second error
in the ephemeris prediction.  If the arcs are shifted to make A
correspond to Kanehekili, as seems likely, then the adjusted B and C
arcs pass through Ra and Loki. 

On May 20 data were obtained which indicates that source C (Loki?) was
less than half as bright as on May 27. 

At longer wavelengths, by June 3 the in-eclipse M flux had reached 21%
of the out-of-eclipse value -- approaching that observed during previous
Loki brightenings. 

Regardless of the hot spot identification, the data show that a
significant "new" source turned on during the week before the Galileo
E15 encounter and was increasing in brightness during that period.

  I was able to get some AO images of Io last wednesday, during the June 3rd 
  eclipse. I used Ganymede as the reference source for the wavefront sensor. 

  The meteo conditions were really poor. Lots of thick cirrus were covering the 
  entire sky and we had several magnitudes of extinction ... degrading the final 
  S/N on our images. No photometry available but we have lots of images to co-add 
  in order to improve the S/N and get a good estimate of the hot-spot location. 

  ...Loki was quite bright while Kanehekili had very low activity. At least 
  one more hot-spot was active south of Loki. 

John Stansberry and Bryan Hilbert also observed the June 3rd event from
the Lowell 72" at 2.3 microns, but reductions are not yet available.
However, John Stansberry does have reductions from the June 10 UT event:

  Here is what I think is a pretty reliable reduction of the eclipse
  photometry from the 980610 event:

  filter	Flux
  ------	-----
  1.7	5.3 GW/micron/Str
  2.3	13.6
  3.5	54.0
  3.8	64.8
  4.8	144.

  Errors are estimated at 5% or less except for at 1.7microns, where it
  is 15-20%.  the L flux seems consistent with the sum of Bob's A,B, and C
  spots, plus some extra (sum of his spots was 36).  The fluxes are also in
  the ballpark of what we saw during the '97 Loki eruption.

  The 2.3 to 3.5 micron color temperature I get is 630 +- 10 K.
  The 1.7 to 2.3 micron color temperature I get is 860 +- 80 K.
  Both are pretty consistent with what we saw during last year's
  Loki eruption, so I'm guessing that Loki may be on, and that Bob
  may have to fix his limb offset.
