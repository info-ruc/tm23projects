Related Question.  

I am working on a robot project with my daughter this summer.  I was 
wondering how many walking robot kits there out there.  I would like a high 
quality one that lends itself to further development.

Also, I have seen most of the robot chassis kits, I believe but have not seen too 
many track models.  Like the paragraph above I am looking for a relatively high 
quality (small, sturdy, reliable, repairable) one.

Anybody know of any?  Tracked preferred but wheeled is ok too.

An option is to build one but I have no clue where to get parts like tracks (belts) 
and gearing to match, gears, etc.  I have tried RC Hobbie shops but they are 
very limited.
