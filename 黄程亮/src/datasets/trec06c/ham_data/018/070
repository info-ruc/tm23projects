Hmmmmmm.. as I recall, there are 47k pullups on those inputs.  These are
used to condition the signals when used as a digital input.  The 'HC11
pink book suggests that any input resistance of greater then 10K will
"...degrade A/D accuracy."  The ADC module draws 400nA continuously.  Your
220K will drop ~80 mV.  This will result in only 6(ish) bit precision.
Also, the ADC subsystem is modeled as 20pF cap.  220K driving such a cap
will increase your acquisition time significatly.   You will definately
want to condition this signal with a low impedance driver.  I suggest an
instrumentation amplifier (a special kind of rail to rail, high frequency
Op-Amp) to condition that signal.  National Semiconductor offers many
single supply, rail to rail devices. Analog Devices has a pretty keen
selection too.  I don't remember the particular part number, but NS has a
swift selection tree.  The output impedance of an OpAmp is quite low.
This means you will be able to leave the 47K's on the HB ADC inputs alone.
