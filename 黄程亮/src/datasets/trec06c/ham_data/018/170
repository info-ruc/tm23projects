 Do you happen to know if those changes are linear? Something like this
would make a cool replacement for the MAS on the Talon. It uses a series of
honeycombs (that form little diamond shapes). Then it measures the number
of spinning vortices coming off the honeycomb (via ultrasound) -it's called
the Karmen-???? phenomenon. It's also a pretty restrictive piece of the
intake path. 

  A cylinder with one of these platinum wires crossing it (along w/the
extra sensors needed) with a PIC as the glue would really be slick, as long
as the mapping (or math) to do something useful with it wasn't to hairy.
