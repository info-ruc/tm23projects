I've been using IC3.2 on Windows NT/4.0 with very few problems.  I used
to have IC lock up occasionally, but only when I disconnected the Handy
Board at weird times.  Once I was more careful about disconnecting the
Handy Board only when IC was at a command prompt (not running a routine)
I didn't have any more troubles.
