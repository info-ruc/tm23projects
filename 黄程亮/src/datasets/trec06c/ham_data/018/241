        Other than using Lego or fischertechnik tracks (about equal in
durability) the only option I could come up with is (are) the radio control
tanks made by Tamiya.  You can find these at:

http://www.hobbyweb.com/

        Browse under Tamiya, Armor/AFV, 1/16 scale.  The 3 older models:
#56004 "King Tiger"; #56003 "Flakpanzer Gepard"; and #56002 "Leopard A4" are
suitable for radio control.  Although the bodies of these models are
plastic, they have a stiff metal chassis, good (metal&plastic) running gear
& tracks  gearboxes and may even still come with the gearmotors.

        Now the bad news.  Have $500 ready.
