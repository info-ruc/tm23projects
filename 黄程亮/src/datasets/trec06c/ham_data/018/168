This is what Fred Martin wrote in a earlier message to this mail list.

This is the approximate breakdown of the HB memory space.

User program object code + user global variables: 16320 bytes available
Runtime pcode OS: 7936 bytes
Used stack space for user processes: 6656 bytes
Used buffer for interaction process: 256 bytes
Used buffer for printing: 256 bytes used


Editing out any unused functions/procedures in the library will save some
space but not much.
