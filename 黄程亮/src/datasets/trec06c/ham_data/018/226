Subject: IC with Botboard 2

Does anyone have experience modifying IC for use with the BotBoard 2? (i.e.,
changing address for the beeper, etc.) I have been able to get IC to download
and run, but I would like to customize it to fit the hardward on the BB2.

On a related note, are there docs for the library functions and built in
fuctions beyond the stuff in the HandyBoard manual?
