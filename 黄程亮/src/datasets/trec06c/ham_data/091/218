   RTs are probably going to be fine but display presentation is likely to 
be way out of place.  I'd recommend using version 3 of DMDX and TimeDX, 
version 2 still had allergies to some machines.  Otherwise if you're not 
using movies or other big image files you need to hunt up new video drivers 
and otherwise make sure TimeDX is functioning properly (have a look at the 
Refresh Rate Test documentation), 120Hz displays are still relatively 
rare.  If none of that fixes it it's probably reformat time.
