CS352h-ers,

Don't forget that we are discussing the Kessler paper on the Alpha
21264 tomorrow in class.  If you lost your copy (because I know you
were all in class to get one last week), you can find one through the
UT libraries on-line.

1) Go to  http://www.lib.utexas.edu/indexes/i.html


2) Click on IEEE/IEE Electronic Library (IEL) Online

   Note - you must do this on a UT computer since this database is
   domain protected.

3) Search by author "Kessler"

4) Click on "Kessler R.E."  - the paper you want is from IEEE Micro
   magazine - it should be reference #2.

bother reprinting it).
