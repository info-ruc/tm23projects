Dear Sir, 
I am Barrister kenneth uche, a solicitor at law. I am 
the personal attorney to Mr. Ralf Rutherford, who used
to work with Shell Development Company in Nigeria. 
On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and 
their only daughter were involved in a car accident 
along sagbama express road. All occupants of the 
vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I 
have made several enquiries to your embassy here 
to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this 
has also proved unsuccessful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided 
to look for any body who will be willing to assist me 
in recovering the fund valued at US$10.5 million left 
behind by my client before it gets confisicated or 
declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge 
amount were deposited. 
The said Bank has issued me a notice to provide the 
next of kin or have the account confisicated within 
the next twenty one official working days.Since I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 
2 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the
next of kin to the deceased hence I have all the 
legal document to back you up for the claim, so that 
the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. 
Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we 
shall then discuss on how we can sharing the funds 
when it get into your account. I have all necessary 
information and legal documents needed to back you up 
for claim. All I require from you is your honest 
cooperation to enable us see this transaction through.
I guarantee that this will be executed under
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law. 
IF YOU ARE VERY MUCH READY TO PROCEED with me, THEN 
CONTACT ME. 
Best Regards 
Barrister kenneth uche
