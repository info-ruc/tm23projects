   No, it's a mystery to me.  I've gotten a couple of reports that it 
doesn't work yet each time I investigate it it functions 
perfectly.  Perhaps it has something to do with the bitmaps that get used 
or perhaps something cancels the justification mode. If you send me your 
item file and bitmaps zipped up off the list I'll have a look at your 
specific usage and see if I can pin the problem down.
