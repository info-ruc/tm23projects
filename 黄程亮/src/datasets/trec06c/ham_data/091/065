whoops, sorry about that.  what I meant to say was...

from this it isn't really clear to me what the actual proposed changes are, 
rather they've only laid out what the proposed goal is.

would this new service be year-round, or only during the winter months when 
there are two shuttles anyway?

which stops would not benefit from the 10-minute-interval winter service?  i.e. 
who are they skipping?  or are they two completely separate routes?

what would the time between pickups be for SP, warehouse, etc?

In this plan, if I read it right, we (including all of the residents of west
campus) would essentially be forfeiting all of the advantages of a more
frequent winter tech shuttle by allowing this plan to proceed. Right me if
I'm wrong. Do other sims care?

Are you saying that you feel as though those individuals who have to 
travel across the bridge, a windy bridge I might add, some how should 
not be entitled to a van that is available for those who live closer 
to classes in general.  In the winter, yeah there is a lot of snow, 
but you are committed to voting no on a subject that would benefit 
others more so than it would you.  Have a heart guys and weigh not 
only the costs to you but the benefits to others.

Ok, so this isn't some official bill in the works, it's just a question
about other people's experiences with shuttle track. And what's the deal
with it? Half the time, it's not running, a quarter of the time there's
some server-side error, and the remaining quarter the shuttle jumps from
stop to stop in like 6 minute increments, at one point it predicted that
it would arrive at Simmons at something like 16 past, a refresh said it
would be here at 3 past (it went from 3 stops away to two stops away)
then it just showed the shuttle sitting at simmons. Racing down the
stairs at around 4 after scored me little more than a distant view of
the shuttle's rear. Upon my dejected return to shuttle track (yes, with
refreshes) the shuttle appeared to be stopped at simmons for like ten
more minutes. I understand the difficulties involved in efficiently
coordination of the breadth of technologies that shuttle track is
composed of, but surely there must be some degree of improvement on the
way? Is there some massive rebuild on the way that requires the
developers' full attention? If anyone knows what the deal is, I'd really
like to be in the loop, along with (I'm sure) the majority of the
bike/car non-owning residents of this dorm in a distant land. Thanks,
(there haven't been any good rants in a while, so I figured I'd take a
go at it..)
	Best,
	 Adam

The issue is NOT the daytime saferide which goes into Boston, but Tech

i do like the idea of having a shuttle for the NW pplz (esp. Sid-Pac), but
aron is right about tech shuttle being full by the time it reaches simmons
during the winter months. it's not a matter of waiting an extra 10 mins for
a tech shuttle (from the GSC- "One difference introduced by the current plan
is that some users would not receive a reduced waiting time of 10 minutes
between shuttles during the winter schedule hours. Our hope is that these
users would be willing to accommodate this change so that better coverage
can be provided to MIT community members as a whole"). the problem is that
all these grad students and pplz from the other side of the field pile up on
tech shuttle so that by the time it gets to simmons, there is no room. im
sure a lot of pplz who lived in simmons last year experienced this. the tech
shuttle is literally jam packed...every space is taken up...

anyways, i didn't really take a side...but those are my thoughts=)

Before somebody accuses us of being lazy because Simmons isn't that far 
from campus, I'd like to point out that:
1) Our sidewalk gets shovelled long after they shovel dorm row (Mem. Drive)
2) When they do shovel our sidewalk, they do a pretty poor job
3) The incredibly cracked and uneven pavement only worsens with harsh weather

that was my experience last year with the tech shuttle.  i mean, i have 
that problem now sometimes...i'm about to get on and the guy is like, no 
sorry, no more people.  the lower wait time isn't the only thing the west 
side dorms are losing....but simmons gets the raw end of the deal with the 
west side dorms because of how many people choose to use the shuttle in the 
winter.

It's unfair that people in Sid-Pac, Edgerton, etc. have no access to any 
TechShuttle.  But even with 10 minute tech shuttles, it is often packed by the 
time it gets to Simmons because of people getting on at Tang.  Maybe if they 
had one "grad-dorm" route and one "undergrad" route (basically, put Tang on a 
different route) this would even out, and every 20 minutes would still work and 
we could get on.

There were many times last year when the Tech Shuttle was packed by the
time it came to Simmons.  The shuttle didn't even stop; it just drove on
by.  So I haven't actually read what these proposed changes are, but
Simmons got shafted last year even with the current tech shuttle route and
winter schedule.

Is it the case that most people are taking the shuttle just to get to 77
Mass Ave. and then walk inside the buildings to their various classes.
Or is it that most people are taking it to Sloan from Simmons.  I think
it is probably the former.  If this is the case, perhaps the new route
could cover all the dorms and the NW section of campus and just stop
back at 77 - not loop around to Sloan.  This way, two shuttles would
stop by most of the undergrad dorms (including Simmons) and then if
people needed to go to Sloan, they could catch the Sloan-bound
Techshuttle from 77 (or the Fleet stop at the intersection of Mass Ave
and Vassar).

I don't know, maybe I'm restating an idea that has already been posted
here, but in any case, this seems like it would alleviate some of the
troubles brought on by solely redirecting the second shuttle.

Personally, I come from a much colder and snowier place than here and 
can deal with the walk to 77.  However, the only times I ever take 
any of the shuttles is to go to my early morning classes at Sloan. I 
don't think it would be fair to cut out the west dorm people from 
Sloan since there are a lot of people who need to go there (more 
sloan blg folks on the west side than other parts of campus) and its 
at least a 20 minute walk. However, I agree wholeheartedly that 
something needs to  be done about the compactness of the shuttle when 
it reaches Simmons. Even over the summer, the Tech shuttle was often 
full at Simmons.

Yup, underground monorail that would traverse the famous underground 
tunnels... that would be the first major step MIT could make towards 
connecting west campus with east campus. Oh wait, if there were underground 
tunnels, no one would need monorails because the underground tunnels could 
be heated and we might as well just walk to east campus under the ground. 
If you're too lazy to walk, MIT could build a moving walkway (like in 
airports).
Or its time to start thinking about teleporters.

Beam me east!
