When the interviewer asks Joy about his "famously cool" attitude towards
Linux, Joy responded, "Re-implementing what I designed in 1979 is not
interesting to me personally. For kids who are 20 years younger than me,
Linux is a great way to cut your teeth. It's a cultural phenomenon and a
business phenomenon. Mac OS X is a rock-solid system that's beautifully
designed. I much prefer it to Linux."

Then again, perhaps there's some parental hubris behind Joy's comments:
Among his other accomplishments, Joy is credited with coding Berkeley
Software Distribution (BSD) Unix, the core underpinnings upon which Mac OS
X is based.
