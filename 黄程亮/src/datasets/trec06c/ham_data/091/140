CS352h-ers,

This is a reminder that you need to submit *all* of the .v and .h
files needed to run your processors....EVEN IF YOU DID NOT MODIFY THE
ORIGINALS!

I'm writing scripts to automatically run your code, so it must be
complete.  Please make sure that you also have an lc35.f file, listing
all of your that are required to run your code.

Cheers,
