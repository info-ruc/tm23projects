Hi.  Has anyone managed to get a Cedrus button box to work with DMDX?  Our
box in an RB-420 which plugs into a serial port on the back of the computer,
and cedrus provide no drivers for it.  On Cedrus's website*, they give some
code in C with apparently can be used to get the box to work with other
programs besides their own product 'superlab', but I've had no luck.  I
would appreciate if anyone could suggest a way to interface it.

Thanks, Andy.
