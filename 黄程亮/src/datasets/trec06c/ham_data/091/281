   Machine freezing (at least under XP) is usually caused by poor video 
drivers (particularly the GeForce video cards).

   If your hardware and it's drivers are working properly a latency in the 
order of a millisecond is perfectly possible.

   Run off to Nvidia's web site or use Windows Update and download their 
reference drivers.  I have good results with the 44.03 drivers if you find 
the latest drivers aren't acceptable, you can usually find places on the 
web that have older drivers.  But the latest ones should be good especially 
once you turn off all the extra stuff they are trying to load.
