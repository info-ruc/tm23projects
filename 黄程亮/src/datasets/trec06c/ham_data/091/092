To N. Christopher Phillips from the Editors of Kluwer SUSY Encyclopedia

Dear Professor Phillips:

You probably know about the new essential Kluwer Academic Publishers
Project "Concise Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry and Noncommutative
Structures in Mathematics and Physics" edited by S. Duplij,
W. Siegel and J. Bagger together with 23 high-level Advisory Editors:
http://www.wkap.nl/prod/b/1-4020-1338-8.

We are pleased to lend your attention to some additional information
which is not fully covered in the standard Kluwer SUSY flyer:
http://www.math.uni-mannheim.de/~duplij/susy/susyflyer.pdf.

1) The 650 pages volume contains over 700 comprehensive articles
and definitions from more than 275 experts, as well as the
author, subject and article indices that catalog more than
450,000 comparisons.

2) The subjects covered are not only supersymmetry, supergravity
and M-theory, but also large amount of the related – standard and
recent - specific questions of quantum field theory, branes,
black holes, classical and quantum gravity, noncommutative
geometry and unified models, as well as pure mathematical topics
– superalgeras, supergroups and supermanifolds, representation
theory, categories, quantum groups and Hopf algebras - and wide
supersymmetry methods applications - in quantum and classical
mechanics, astrophysics, quantum optics, atomic physics, nuclear
physics, genetic code models and statistical physics.

3) There are also biographical articles which cover main life
data of most prominent scientists being in cradle and beginnings
of supersymmetry.


4) The "SUSY Story", a collection of 10 informal articles written by
supersymmetry precursors themselves exclusively for the Encyclopedia,
recalls the truth and unknown facts of SUSY birth - at first hand.

5) The supersymmetry is known to become a Nobel prize problem:
from the session 'Millennium Madness' at the International Superstrings
Conference, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, July 2000
- 'Ten Physics Problems for the Next Millennium' - Problem 4 -
"Is Nature supersymmetric, and if so, how is supersymmetry broken?" -
"...solving any one of these would almost guarantee a trip to Stockholm".

We realize that the price of the "Concise Encyclopedia of
Supersymmetry" could be seen steep, it doesn't depend on the
Editors, but on the Publisher only. Despite we dare hope that the
modern flexible grant system, having a special separate line for
books, could help in getting such extraordinary, comprehend and
first in the discipline 275-authors volume.

Your kind questions, comments and remarks concerning the volume
as a whole and concrete papers and terms, possible misprints
would be greatly appreciated.

We understand that in a single encyclopedic volume one cannot
cover questions which would interest all the scientists.
Nevertheless, we would appreciate your professional interest, and
it would be much helpful, if you could inform your colleagues,
students and, in case, your local library about the "Concise
Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry" which would be of great general
informational use. Thank you.

Professor Phillips, please be assured that we respect your privacy, and
this is a one time message. The E-mail <XXX@XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXX.XXX>
applied by you for scientific communication was taken from
N. Christopher Phillips's preprint submitted to LANL archive.

Thank you for your kind attention and interest to the "Concise
Encyclopedia of Supersymmetry and Noncommutative Structures in
Mathematics and Physics".

Respectfully yours,
The Editors
