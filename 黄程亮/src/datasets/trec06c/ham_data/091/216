Hi.  This will only be useful if your DMDX rtf file is displaying media.

How quickly are you displaying your stimuli?  Also, what size in MB are
they, and what type of stimuli are they?  If the two computers are different
specs, then I suspect that your second computer running the expt is no way
near as powerful as the first.  To test to see whether this is the case, you
could remove <bmp> or <dv> from your dmdx rtf file, and run the expt with
the stimuli simply displayed as text on the screen (e.g. <bmp> "Hello
world"; becomes "Hello world";  all that is now displayed is the name of the
media you were presenting).  If your getting the same sort of errors as
before, then i dont know what the problem is.  However, if there are no
errors, try reducing the size of the media in MB that you are presenting or
give DMDX longer to load each image. Alternatively, have a look at the
medialife keyword.

Hope that helps, Andy.

Hi all,
I seem to have a timing problem with DMDX version 2, installed on a Dell XPS
1500 (all other applications have been removed). When I run a simple
reaction time experiment using a rtf file that has run the experiment
perfectly on another computer, the presentation of the stimuli appears to be
sped up and I get an error message on every trial (a sample of the azk file
is below). Could you please tell me whether this means the reaction time
measure is inaccurate? If so, do you have any advice or suggestions
regarding a solution?
Regards, Jacquie
