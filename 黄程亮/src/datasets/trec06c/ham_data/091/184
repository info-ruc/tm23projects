CS352H-ers,

I wanted to remind you that you can pick up your graded projects
tomorrow in Gem's office.  Attached to your graded project is a sheet
that shows which of our battery of tests your project passed and which
it failed.  The tests themselves are now available at:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs352h/homework/project_grading_tests.html

Project grading was based on your write-up, how your assignment
performed on the tests, and an assessment of your approach and
implementation.

Cheers,
