 The Department of Mathematics at Louisiana State University
announces a major expansion of its professorial faculty
and of its graduate program.

 Six (6) new professorial hires are planned for 2004.

 All areas of mathematics will be considered at all professorial levels.
Senior candidates may recommend additional candidates to form
new research groups or to strengthen existing groups.

   * Applications and nominations are invited at all professorial levels.
* Research excellence is required.
   * Commitment to graduate and undergraduate education is expected.

 As part of LSU Flagship Agenda,
XXXX://appl003.lsu.edu/acadaff/flagship.nsf/index/
the expansion will be sustained over
the next several years with up to sixteen (16) new professorial
positions filled.

 This expansion continues after the targeted hiring experienced in the
last four years in which a new group in Materials Science was formed,
other areas of departmental research were strenghthened by new hires,

and a departmental Beowulf cluster with 32 nodes was installed.
At the same time, the University installed a Boewulf cluster with 1024
processors which ranked fastest cluster in the world according to the
September, 2002, Top500 listing of installed clusters.

semester. Minorities and women are strongly encouraged to apply.
Confidentiality of initial inquiries will be maintained.
For details, consult the departmental Employment Opportunities webpage or
send email to profjobs@math.lsu.edu.

 The graduate program is expanding from 70 to 100
graduate students with the addition of ten (10)
new assistantships per year, for three years.
These assistantships will be awarded competitively
with stipends of up to $25,000.
