Folks,

A small number of issues have come to my attention.  These are all
problems that should have come to light 5 weeks ago when you had the
assignment to help debug the assembler and simulators.  At this point,
they will not be fixed for this semester, so you will all have to
figure out ways to work around the problems.  This may mean altering
your test programs so that the issue does not manifest itself.

1) Bugs in the assembler or simulators:

> We're havin trouble getting the assembler to compile JSRR
> instructions.  To our understanding, the syntax was JSRR BaseR,
> OFFSET. However, the assembler won't recognize "JSRR R0, #2". Is this

The assembler has a bug such that it will not recognize the immediate
offset for the JSRR instruction.  "JSRR R0" should work though.

> .END

There appears to still be a problem in LC35 ISA simulator (not
verilog) for ASH.

Another apparent issue with the JSRR in the instruction simulator.

The original LC35 verilog code was incorrect.


2) There have been some minor problems uncovered in the test programs
   submitted along with HW #4.  If your name is mentioned below, you
   might want to take a look at the test program in question.  If you
   don't have time until after finals, no problem.
