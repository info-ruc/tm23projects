Positions in Theoretical Surface Science as Research Associate

Applications are invited for two Research Associate Positions in the area
of computational theoretical surface science in the group of Professor
Stampfl in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, Australia.
The research involves development and application of novel ab initio
based statistical mechanical schemes for the study of processes and
reactions at surfaces; e.g., kinetic Monte Carlo including adparticle
interactions via the lattice-gas approach, for calculation of reaction
rates in heterogeneous catalysis, or stable and metastable phases in
crystal growth. The applicant must hold a Ph.D. in physics, chemistry,
or materials science, and have good knowledge of electronic structure
theory, and experience in first-principles calculations.

The positions offer good opportunity for international collaborations,
and the campus is located near the heart of Sydney.  The positions are
full-time and fixed term for two years, subject to the completion of a
satisfactory mandatory probation period of six months, commencing as
soon as possible. Further offers of employment of up to one year may be
available, subject to funding and need.  For further information, contact
Professor Catherine Stampfl on (02) 9351 5901 or e-mail:
stampfl-at-physics.usyd.edu.au or visit:
http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~stampfl/ To apply, send 5 copies of the
application to: The Personnel Officer, College of Sciences and
Technology, Carslaw Building, (F07), The University of Sydney, NSW, 2006
by the 14th of February. The application should quote reference number:
A01/004499, address the selection criteria, and include a CV, the names,
addresses, e-mail, fax and phone number of two referees.
