It may not be to do with XP - I also have a windows 2000 machine that it is
doing the same on.  I have timed the video mode I am using in TimeDX.  I
suspect it is something to do with machines rather than the program as I
have installed it on 3 other machines today (one Sony laptop using windows
XP!) and it works fine.  Are there any annoying features in windows I need
to disable?
