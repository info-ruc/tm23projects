Hi, everyone,

I meet a problem when I try to set up TIMEDX in an IBM notebook computer at the stage of "time video mode" test, and the feedback information is as follows,

Create surface failed!
DDERR_INVALIDPIXELFORMAT (88760091)
pixel format was invalid as specified.

I have tried many kinds of video modes, but always failed.

Could anyone be so kind to give me some suggestions on how to solve it? Many thanks.


Best,
Zhuang Jie
