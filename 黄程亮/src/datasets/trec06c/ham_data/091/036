CS352hers -

I put up a webpage of all the test cases for the lc35 datapath that you
guys turned in for #5 on hw4.  It is linked off the homework webpage under
the project description:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs352h/homework/lc35pipeline_tests.html

You guys can check out each other's tests and use them to test your
pipelined datapath for the project.

Remember to put headers on your assembly programs in the future with a
detailed description of the test, as well as authors, etc.

Enjoy,
Jenn Sartor
