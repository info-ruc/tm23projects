Register and try it out.  You can drag and drop the "post to del.icio.us"
link to your bookmarks tool bar (this works in netscape/ie/safari/camino/mozilla).

Then, when you're on a page that you want to submit to the site (you
can use it to handle all of your bookmarks if you like...), you click
on the toolbar link(button) you've created which immediately takes
you to a form to add some extra info like special tags that you can
create at random (such as "Astronomy" or "Bush" or "Hubble-Porn").

The community might get over run by spammers, but so far, is extremely
useful.
