Hi all,
I seem to have a timing problem with DMDX version 2, installed on a Dell
XPS 1500 (all other applications have been removed). When I run a simple
reaction time experiment using a rtf file that has run the experiment
perfectly on another computer, the presentation of the stimuli appears
to be sped up and I get an error message on every trial (a sample of the
azk file is below). Could you please tell me whether this means the
reaction time measure is inaccurate? If so, do you have any advice or
suggestions regarding a solution?
Regards, Jacquie
