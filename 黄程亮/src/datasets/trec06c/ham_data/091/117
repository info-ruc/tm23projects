   There should be another line of information after Failed to Make Item 6 
of Resource 3 which should give me a better idea about what's going 
wrong.  It's something about your version of windows rather than anything 
to do with your audio input and it's either got to do with the icon I use 
to indicate if the VOX is active (fixable) or something to do with the 
trackbars (way bad).
