   Hmm, dunno that I ever tested the SOB in an XP machine, I suspect there 
was some good reason for me sticking it in the ME box but I sure can't 
recall what it was.  One of the people in England that commissioned the 
work to use that card might have a better idea.  It's entirely possible 
that Keithley's miserable software does something different under XP, if 
other users have no idea I'll look at it next week after I finish about 
three other jobs that I haven't gotten to this week...
