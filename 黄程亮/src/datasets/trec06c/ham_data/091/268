ATTN,

MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


I am SOLOMON ALI.The chief accountant of The Nigeria
National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head five man tender
board in charge
of contract award and payments approvals.I came to know of
you in my
search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential
transaction
which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a
foreign 
account.

There were series of contracts executed by aconsortion of 
multinationals
in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation
(NNPC) among which were for the following:-

1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a
crude down 
stream
products distribution and subsequent evacuation:- $8,
Billion United
States Dollars.

..2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the
various
refineries in the country $115 million Uited States
Dollars.

3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products
(depots) 
$190
Million United States Dollars.

The original value of these contracts were delebrately over
invoiced in
the sum U$69,000.000 (sixty nine Million United States
Dollars Only)
which has now been approved and is now ready to be
transferred, being
that the companies that actually executed these contracts
have been
fully paid the projests officially commissioned.It does not
matter
whether or not your comapny does contracts project of that
nature
described here, the assumption is that your company won the
major
contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.

Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer
the total
amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of
conduct bureau
(civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign
accounts in
our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at
this junction
enormous.
In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the
transferred sum, 
while
5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external)
between the parties in the course of the transaction, and
the remaining
75% is for us,The Nigerian officials.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the
ministry of
finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate
transfer of
the fund within 14 working days subject to your
satisfaction of the
above stated terms.Our assurance is that your role is risk
free, I
accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for
mutual 
security
of the fund, the whole approval procedures will be
officially and
legally processed with the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned
amount.

Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we
shall through
our same connections withdraw all documents used from all
the concerned
government ministries for 100% security risk free.Once
more, I want you
to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil
service of
my country, I am very careful to have my image and career
deemed.

Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you
are or not
interested in this deal, if you are not, it will enable us
scout for
another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where
you are
interested send the required documents.One blank letter
head, 
oneinvoice
sheet and your bank particulars through my above address as
time is not
on our side in the business. Send by Email for security
reasons.

Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest
co-operation.

Very truly yours,

SOLOMON ALI
