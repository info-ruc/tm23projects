Folks,

I have updated and released a new version of the unpipelined verilog
that fixes a bug in the shift instructions.  You can download a new
version from the usual place - the updated tar file is lc35.tar (same
name as original).

I have also created a revision log for the verilog at:  

  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs352h/homework/hw.html

The old tar files will be saved and will be available under the
filename described on that page.

If you want to see the fix - just run the diff program on each pair of
files:

  csh> diff oldfile.v newfile.v

Cheers,
