Hi,

I have 2 questions I would appreciate any help in answering.

1.) I would like to know if DMDX would be capable of displaying 2 pictures 
one after the other such that each lasts for exactly 1 refresh cycle and that a 
seperate output code be written to the PIO to indicate the duration of each 
picture.

2.) Can DMDX use the parallel port as an ouput device instead of the PIO card 
and if so how?

Thanks in advance.
