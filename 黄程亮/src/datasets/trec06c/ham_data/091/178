DMDX has been working fine on my machine until just recently. (Pentium, 
AMD 1700  machine, NVidia Gforce4 integrated card...)

Then  I got report: Directx reports no support for page flipping! The 
video card in this machine is not adequate for DMDX purposes.
(which is not true because It has been working properly for long time.)

Noting works: I simple could not select video mode, and do all settings.

I tried all things I knew that could cure: reinstall video drivers, new 
directx (8.2, 8.1), reinstall DMDX (3.0.2.08), in all possible 
combinations but still same error message.

I would appreciate any suggestion.
Thanks,

Mario Fific
