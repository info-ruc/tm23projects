CS352h-ers,

We have finished grading the projects and the exams.  The final exam
median was 111/152.  The high score was 142 and the low score was 45.

On the projects, we ran a battery of tests on the code you submitted,
in addition to reading your reports and looking at the code.  Five
teams submitted code that passed all of the tests - Congrats!  The
scores on the final project were based loosely on how well your code
did on the tests.  Grades ranged from 75 (poorly on tests) to 100 (all
tests passed).  Most people fell into the 90-100 range.  I'm pleased
you all did so well - I know it was a challenging project.  I hope you
learned a lot (not just about pipelining, but also about debugging and
complexity management).

On Tuesday, you may come by Gem's office to pick up your graded final
project papers and the exam solutions.  You may look at the graded
exams, but you may not keep them.  I will retain them for my records.
In the meantime, I have posted your final grades on the on-line
egradebook which should be accessible via UT-Direct.

Best wishes and Happy Holidays.  I'm sure I will see all of you soon.
