Subject: [DMDX] naming task

We are trying to start a naming task with the dmdx. The items 
appear correctly and the answers are recorded in voice files.

Our problem is that the accountant of time doesn't stop when the 
answer is emitted.

The syntax that we have written for the time being is the following 
one:    
<n 15> <cr>> d 10> <clfb> <azk> dbc or> <dwc 255255255> <id 
DigitalVox> 
<idRecordVocal> <id"teclado"> <t3000> <mr"+espacio">    

The task is carried out in a portable computer with Windows XP 
and a compatible microphone for PC.    

Thank you for your answer.
