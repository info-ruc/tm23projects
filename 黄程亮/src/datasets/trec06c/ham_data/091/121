Request for assistance.

It is my pleasure to write you after much consideration since telephone communication can not be suitable enough to communicate to you at first. I am the only son of my father, late Chief Alfred Ackerman from Kwantal Zulu in
Republic of South Africa (SA). I am 20yrs old.

My father was a limited liability Cocoa and Gold merchant in Johannesburg South Africa before his untimely death after his business trip to Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to negotiate on a cocoa and gold business he wanted to invest in
Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

A Week after he came back from Abidjan, he was attacked with my mother by unknown assassins, which my mother died instantly but my father died after five days in a private hospital on that faithful afternoon. I didn't know that my
father was going to leave me after I had lost my mother. But before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die. He disclosed to me that he deposited the sum of 15,800,000,00 US Dollars (Fifteen million eight hundred
thousand dollars) in a bank here in Abidjan, Côte d'ivoire.That the money was meant for his cocoa and Gold company he wanted to establish in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire though, according to my father he deposited the money in a confident
account of the bank and he handed to me all the relevant documents of the deposited fund and instructed me to seek for a reliable and trust worthy business partner for my life time investment abroad.

Now I have succeeded in locating the bank here in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire and I am soliciting for your assistance to help me to transfer this money out from Abidjan to your safe account abroad so that we will invest it in any meaningful lucrative business in your country because this is my only hope in life.

Awaiting to hear from you so that we can discuss the modalities of this transaction. Please kindly contact me through email immediately for more discussion. Thanks for your kind attention.

Yours sincerely,

Mathew Arckerman.
