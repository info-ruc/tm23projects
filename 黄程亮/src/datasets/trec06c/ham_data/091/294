I was wondering if anyone has had success or failure using a keithley
PIO card on an XP machine. I am currently failing. Everything tests okay
in the DriverLINX test panel; the input is being received. DMDX even
locates the address of the PIO, but when I use the PIO test in time-DMDX
it doesn't respond to input. There are no error messages, it simply
doesn't respond. I also get no response from PIO input when running a
script. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Angelina
