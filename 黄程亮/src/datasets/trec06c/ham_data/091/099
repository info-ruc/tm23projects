There is a way you can do this.  If you want to be really adventurous, you
could create a multitude of bars at different angles (e.g. use corel rave or
the likes to output a 'video' of the bar rotating between 0 and 90 degrees
at say 25 frames per second as a series of bmp's... definately possible,
would require a lot of fiddling though), and then create an experiment to
display a series of bars images portraying different angles very very
rapidly given the impression* of motion (I've got a message in the DMDX
thread explaining how to do this, but its disappeared for some reason...
think I posted it in 2001).  I'd use Excel to make such a DMDX experiment
(A).  Otherwise, you could get bogged down with code.  Not too sure about
how to get the superimposing bit to work without a HUGE amount of effort.
Anyone any ideas?

*computers/tv's/cinema do this anyway, so its not really a trick.
