ATTN X. XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  !!!
 
PLEASE GRANT ME YOUR INDULGENCE TO NOTIFY YOU OF THIS ISSUE. 
 
I am Mr.Phalabo Langa, an external auditor with one of the prime banking institutions in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
 
THE PROPOSITION: 
In the course of performing my professional duty as an auditor in one of the banks, I discovered a domant
account belonging to a french man, (Name withheld), he was a merchant formerly working in Witwatersrand
Johannesbourg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa. On further investigations, I discovered that he died some
years ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431,and he had a closing balance as at the end of
September 2000, money worth (Thirty Million Eight Hundred USD) and the bank now expects his next of kin/ beneficiary to come up for claims of his estate.Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in
touch with any of the his family or relatives but, to no success. 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of his relations that, the bank management under the influence of her Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, are making plans for the money to be decleared "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be donated to the South Africa Trust Fund for the acquisition of arms and ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World in General. 
In order to avert this negative development, I am now seeking your willingness and readiness to have you stand as the next of kin to the deceased so that the fund will be released and transfered into your account as the beneficiary / next of kin. The need for a foreigner to stand as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that, the customer was a foreigner therefore, a Local person here in my country cannot stand as the next of kin so as to avoid
suspicion. 
With collective effort by both of us, all documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out with the assistance of an attorney. However, the department of Justice have issued an order of "MANDAMUS" to locate any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies). I am assuring you that this deal is 100% Risk Free. Furthermore, your share will be 30% of the total sum, while the rest of 70% will be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes, according to agreement between both parties.Although, I intended to invest some part of my own share into funding of a charity organisation. 
The name of beneficiary will be made in your favour before the bank and also with the Probate Registry in the ministry of justice of the Government of South Africa. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as will be arranged,upon receipt of your positive response, I will send to you by email a draft copy of the application which you will preview and send to the attorney for him to apply to the bank on your behalf. 
Kindly indicate your interest and capability of striking this deal with me, so as to enable me make arrangements with the attorney that will guide us in making you the legal and authentic next of Kin /beneficiary. 
Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality,all further correspondence will be through my alternative email address: langalanga@bankersmail.com
Accept my warm regards as I await your response. 
Sincerely 
Mr.Phalabo Langa
(Auditor) 
Jo'Burg, South Africa.
