   It's possible in theory, all the audio gets mixed together by 
DirectX.  Whether in practice the machine has the resources to do it is 
another thing.  You'll need a very well equipped machine to handle 2100 
sound buffers at the same time which is what would happen if you tried to 
play them all in the same item.  If it doesn't work you could always append 
all the audio files into one and use the <streamingaudio> keyword to play 
it along with the <digitalvideo>.  And if they drift too far by the end of 
the video (and it's a concern) then I'd mix them all into the video beforehand.
