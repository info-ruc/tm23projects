&lt;bold&gt;Subject: &lt;/bold&gt;Re: Fwd From Gloria Frym



Dear Gloria Frym (and Annie),


The fiction editor of The New Yorker, Bill Buford, stepped down last

year.  The new fiction editor is a woman in her early 30s, Deborah

Treisman.  The poetry ed. there is Alice Quinn.  The poetry ed. at

The Nation has been Grace Schulman for the past 30 years.


Jim


&lt;excerpt&gt;As one who has subscribed to the New Yorker through three
chief

editors,  I too have wondered about the sanity of the poetry editor.

Writing, publishing books, teaching poetry and fiction, mentoring MFA

thesis work, and reading the numerous poetries being disseminated

during our era--not to mention reviewing poetry books and

applications for graduate programs--well, one has to be ecumenical,

even though one has one's aesthetic biases.

Once in a while, the New Yorker publishes a wonderful poem,

especially by a poet who has a contract (although I wonder if they

still do that--the promise to publish x number of the poet's poems a

year).  But one has to consider the context of poetry published in

magazines devoted to other genres, as well as the audience to whom

the magazine speaks.  The New Yorker seems to publish poems for

intelligent commuters and professionals who don't know much about

poetry.  The Nation, with radical politics and so many remarkable

articles about the ills and miseries and corruptions of our times,

rarely publishes a decent poem except those by their contest winners.

Certainly, nothing to take the top of your head off. The Atlantic

Monthly, which offers excellent writing, personal essays,  one piece

of fiction per issue, occasionally has a poem one isn't embarassed

by.

What's mysterious is that the poetry editors of major magazines must

change every so often, yet the general quality of the poetry remains

the same.  On the other hand, the New Yorker has had the same chief

fiction editor for decades, and frequently publishes great stories.

I suspect Roger Angell has a huge cadre of savvy,assistant fiction

editors.


These magazines would do well by having a group of poetry editors

with different, even clashing, aesthetics, and make space for the

variety of poetries being produced in a country that claims it's

devoted to "diversity."  So Katha, got any pull at The Nation?

Deborah (last name escapes me), the poetry editor of the New Yorker,

how about you?

A few years ago, a poet named Sparrow, if you recall, picketed the

offices of the New Yorker, saying that his poetry was just as bad as

the poetry they were publishing, and therefore they should publish

some of his poems.  And they did!  And his poetry is great!

 Answer to (#1) I think the New Yorker sells brand-name products

(goods in the ads, goods in the poetry/fiction world). (#2) I do not

think the editor is a dope and (#3) what is taste? Taste comes from?

one's background? experience in the area (i.e. how much the editor

has read, how knowledgeable the editor? does he/she have broad

experience? cross-culturally, etc? one's own needs)?

 Laura


Laura, no they weren't rhetorical questions.  I'm very curious about

how poets evaluate the work of other poets, and so, when people say

things like "publish crappy poems" and "poems that stand up," I want

to know how they know.  I've read some poems in the New Yorker that

I considered very fine, and some that made me wonder what the editor

was thinking.  But they might have been the opposite of someone

else's reactions.  I've read the third or fourth book of a poet I

admired and thought, "Whoa, I think you need to find some new

material," and the book was nominated for/won a big prize.  Is it

purely a matter of taste?  Surely not.  We can probably all agree

that Jewel is not a great poet.  (What about some of the hip-hop

poets?)  I am wondering how much of our judgment of the quality of

poems is a matter of personal taste.  Dickinson said if it blew the

top of her head off, she knew it was poetry.  That seems pretty

simple, but perhaps it's also simplistic.  I find that, as I grow

old in poetry, my tastes become both more expansive and more

critical.  I am willing to tolerate a lot more not-understanding, so

I enjoy more edgy work and, at the same time, become more critical

and impatient with poets who seem to write the same thing over and

over, even if it is well written, and those who seem intent on not

making meaning through poetry. However, I also look at the work I

really connect to, and a heck of a lot of it has been written by

middle-aged white women!  What happens to my evaluating function

when I read work that is so "other" I can't connect to it in any

personal way?  Frankly, I can't tell if the work is bad, or I am so

hopelessly conditioned by my white middle classness that I'm not up

to it.


Just curious how other people deal with these questions.

  Yes, indeed. I came down with a cold this past

ingested as Deborah suggests, every 2 hours all day

Monday. I was much improved and ready for work on

books by wom-po poets in production at our other imprints...Ingrid
Wendt's

book THE ANGLE OF SHARPEST ASCENDING is due out in a few weeks from
WordTech

Editions (<a href=http://www.wordtechweb.com>http://www.wordtechweb.com</a>), Marilyn Taylor's book SUBJECT TO

CHANGE will be out next month from David Robert Books

(<a href=http://www.davidrobertbooks.com>http://www.davidrobertbooks.com</a>), and Jendi Reiter's book A TALENT FOR

SADNESS was out last fall from Turning Point Books

(<a href=http://www.turningpointbooks.com>http://www.turningpointbooks.com</a>). To say nothing of Allison Joseph's

WORLDLY PLEASURES, also just out from Word Press.


All the imprints may be a little confusing, I know...the "big picture"
about

our publishing is at <a href=http://www.wordtechcommunications.com>http://www.wordtechcommunications.com</a>.


Thanks!

&lt;excerpt&gt;Lately, I've been seeing poems around by Word Pres authors.
I'm impressed

with the great quality of the work given how recently the press was
started.


I don't have much more to say about it...just wanted to point them out
to

you all.

GOETHE'S DESK


I once saw Goethe's desk, in Goethe's house,

a lovely piece,warm wood on which to write,

while on a floor below a dozen servants

tiptoed their way to make his tea and keep

his carriage at the ready. Outside the casement

gardeners trimmed his plants. The world of Weimar

begged for his company and he tried hard to learn

all that there was to know and write it down.


If I'd had Goethe's desk I might have spent

a lifetime writing Faust. Instead I do

a dozen servants' jobs and write my lines

stealing the time from home. My desk's the kitchen table

No clavichord nearby. The washer's thrum

would drown it anyhow. I learn the hard way.

Washing the muddy footprints off the floor

I rinse the hopes of grandeur out of me.

*****************************

FIESTA


He desplegado mi orfandad

sobre la mesa, como un mapa.

Dibuje el itinerario

hacia mi lugar al viento.

Los que llegan no me encuentran.

Los que espero no existen.


Y he hebido licores furiosos

para tranmutar los rostros

en un angel,en vasos vacios.


FIESTA


I unfurled my homelessness

across the table, like a map.

I traced my journey as far

as my place in the wind.

The ones who get there never meet me.

The ones I wait for don't exist.


And I drink wild spirits

to change faces into

angels, into empty cups.


***********************************


MENDIGA VOZ


Y aun me atrevo a amar

el sonido de la luz en una hora muerta,

el color del tiempo en un muro abandonado.


En mi mirada lo he perdido todo.

Es tan lejos pedir. Tan cerca saber que no hay.


A BEGGING VOICE


And sometimes I dared to love

the sound of light was a dead hour

the color of time in an abandoned wall


In my gazing I have lost it all.

It is so hard to ask. So easy to know I need.


**********************************************

un golpe del alba en las flores

me abanona ebria de nada y de luz lila

ebria de immovidad y de certeza


dawn strikes in the flowers

leaving me drunk with nothingness and lilac light

drunk with stillness and with certainty


******************************************


El poema que no digo,

el que no merezco.

Miedo de ser dos

camino del espejo:

alguien en mi dormido

me come y me bebe


The poem I do not write,

the one I do not deserve.

Fear of being two

pathway in a mirror:

someone sleeping within me

eats me and drinks me.

***************************


FOR MY FATHER


Rain for five days. The field's a lake,

the house walls seeping wet.

Before dawn broke I lay and listened to

a world awash with water.


Inside the ward it's dry and far too warm

for tears. I sit beside the man

stuffed in a wheelchair, hands like Lear's

plucking at flowers that were never there.


This was, and is, my father. Quite oblivious

to rain outside or me.

Once he would tell me stories

tales of wars and men, Troy and Tobruk

a blur of past exploits. Now, waiting to die

words fail. Blankness for him. For me

prospect of summer, somewhere through the rain.


NOMBRARTE


no el poema de tu ausencia

solo un dibujo, una grieta en un muro,

algo en el viento, un sabor amargo.


SPEAKING YOUR NAME


Not a poem on your absence

just a sketch, a crack in a wall,

something in the wind

a taste of bitterness
