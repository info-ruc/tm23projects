Dear Math Department Professor:
 
I hope you had a relaxing break. As you probably know, OsPIRG is a 
student-directed advocacy group based here at the University of 
Oregon. We are writing to ask you to sign on to our attached letter 
as part of our Affordable Textbooks Campaign.  OsPIRG is currently 
engaged in a statewide campaign that seeks way to reduce textbook 
costs for students. Specifically, we are attempting to adopt ways in 
which to increase the length of time that used (and less expensive) 
textbooks stay on the textbook market as well as ways to reduce the 
price of brand new textbooks.  Both OsPIRG and CalPIRG regarding the 
costs and distribution of textbooks did an in-depth research project. 
They have found that a factor that diminishes the amount of time a 
used textbook remains viable is the frequency with which a new 
textbook edition is produced, since a new edition tends to make all 
older editions obsolete and unusable. Anecdotally, many faculty and 
students have expressed the opinion that the content differences 
between new and older textbook editions appear to be minimal and not 
worth the increased cost associated with having to purchase a 
textbook completely new. 
The reports also found that a factor that appears to increase the 
price of new textbooks are additional instructional materials, such 
as a workbook, or a CD, that often come bundled together in shrink 
wrap packaging with the core textbook. Many faculty and students have 
also expressed the opinion that the additional instructional material 
that are bundled together with the main text, while informational, 
are not ever used for the class. 
The authors of the report surveyed faculty who taught one of the top 
five most purchased textbooks in their Fall quarter classes and in 
total, over 150 faculty members from 13 schools in California and 
Oregon responded to the survey.  The results of the survey indicate 
that the average student now spends almost $900/year on textbooks, 
and that prices have risen at twice the rate of inflation since 1996.
Many faculty members expressed concern that one reason why textbooks 
have gotten so expensive is that publishers often produce new 
textbook editions with only cosmetic changes, forcing students to 
forgo the older, less expensive edition. In particular, widespread 
concern was found among mathematics faculty members that newer, more 
expensive editions of introductory calculus texts are needlessly 
produced, despite little to no change in the field since the end of 
the 19th century.
A widely cited example is the popular introduction-to-calculus 
textbook, Calculus: Early Transcedentals, written by James Stewart 
and published by Brooks/Cole. The changes between the current edition 
(produced last year), and the previous edition (produced in 1999), 
are primarily cosmetic. The price difference, however, between a used 
copy of the previous edition ($97 on the average) and a new copy of 
the current edition ($137 on the average) is around $40 - quite 
significant to many students.
In addition, Brooks/Cole offers the book online for $125 in the 
United States, but the equivalent of $65 (35 pounds) in England and 
$97 ($125 Canadian) in Canada.  In total 77% of faculty surveyed 
thought that new editions they used were justified "never" to "half 
the time", and a full 40% thought that new editions were "rarely to 
never" justified.
Finally, it was found that online textbooks is a promising way for 
publishers to lower the cost of textbooks, while maintaining or 
increasing their profit margin. Noted New York Times columnist Paul 
Krugman has just offered an online version of his textbook, and is 
promoting this practice in the industry. 
CALPIRG, and the other state PIRGs is calling on Brooks/Cole to 
modify its practices in the following ways:
1. Continue to publish the current edition of this textbook until 
there has been significantly new content in the field of calculus 
that would justify an update.
2. Establish a more transparent and fairer pricing scheme so that 
students in America are getting charged the same amount as their 
counterparts in other countries.
3. Disclose to faculty all of Brooks/Cole's products, their prices, 
and the length of time Brooks/Cole intends to keep the current 
editions of their textbooks and related instructional materials. 
4. Encourage Brooks/Cole to produce Calculus: Early Transcedentals as 
an online textbook, and pass the cost savings on to students.
While the extent of the problem is not limited to calculus texts or 
to Brooks/Cole, we think the problem is most egregiously demonstrated 
in this instance, so we believe that it is smartest to begin here, as 
a means to press for more industry wide changes.
Obviously, this will only work if mathematics faculty members are 
supportive of this effort, and so we are working to fine tune our 
plans before we launch the campaign on January 29. On that date, we 
will release the findings of our survey and announce our effort aimed 
at Brooks/Cole.
I've attached a draft of the letter that we are planning to circulate 
amongst mathematics faculty both here and at 100 other universities 
nationwide.  I was hoping that you would be willing to review both 
documents and offer any comments, feedback and suggestions that come 
to mind. We are asking roughly 30 of your other colleagues on the 
West Coast for feedback as well. If you are interested in reviewing a 
draft copy of our report, I can forward that along to you as well (I 
assumed you'd be too busy for that).
I recognize that the start of the quarter is a busy time for you; it 
would be greatly helpful if you were able to reply by Monday, January 
19. I will phone to follow up, in case you would prefer simply to 
discuss your thoughts over the phone. I can be reached at (541) 
346-4377. Thank you.
 
Sincerely,
Arista Hickman 
 
*******************************************
DRAFT - CONFIDENTIAL - DRAFT
 
We, the undersigned mathematics faculty, are writing to express our 
concern with the cost of your undergraduate mathematics textbook and 
to respectfully request that your company take some simple steps to 
alleviate this problem.

As you know, the cost of college textbooks has risen considerably in 
the last few years. Recent surveys done by the University of 
California (UC), the California Student Public Interest Research 
Group (CALPIRG), and the Oregon Student Public Interest Research 
Group (OSPIRG) show that between 1996 and 2003, the average student's 
yearly textbook costs have risen from $642 to $898, a 40% increase, 
and two times the rate of inflation during that time period. 
Compounded with the overall recent increases in tuition and other 
college costs, we are increasingly concerned for our students' 
ability to either pay for college or to fully take advantage of all 
of the educational opportunities available to them while at college.
 
Naturally, we would like to ensure that textbooks are priced as 
fairly as possible, and we are concerned with the cost of your 
introductory calculus textbook - Calculus: Early Transcedentals, 
Edition Five. We are generally satisfied with the actual content of 
the text. We are concerned, however, with a number of items:
1.  The previous edition of the book (Edition Four) was out on the 
market for only three years before you produced the most current 
edition (Edition Five), in 2003. We believe that most of the changes 
made to the edition were not central to the field - indeed, the field 
of Calculus has not changed much since the end of the 19th century! 
This is significant to students' costs, because a student can buy a 
used version of the current edition for considerably less than a new 
edition. However, it is impossible for students to obtain used copies 
of this book when you produce a new edition. In addition, the 
unnecessary production of new textbook editions also inconveniences 
faculty members, who must spend time revising syllabi and other 
instructional materials to accommodate the "changes" to the text.   
2.  Your website offers the book for $125 in the United States, but 
for the equivalent of $65 (35 pounds) in England and for $97 ($125 
Canadian) in Canada. In our mind, there is no reasonable explanation 
for this.
 
We believe that you would be sympathetic to these issues, and so, as 
a remedy, we are asking your company to commit to the following 
changes in your publishing plan for the aforementioned textbook:
 
1.  Continue to publish the current edition of this textbook until 
there has been significantly new content in the field of calculus 
that would justify an update.
2.  Establish a more transparent and fairer pricing scheme so that 
students in America are getting charged the same amount as their 
counterparts in other countries.
3.  Ensure that your sales materials and sales representatives 
disclose to faculty all of products, their prices, and the length of 
time Brooks/Cole intends to keep on the market the current editions 
of their textbooks and related instructional materials. 
4.  Produce Calculus: Early Transcedentals as an online textbook, and 
pass the cost savings on to students.
 
College costs have risen dramatically in the past year.  
Subsequently, we believe that quick action must be taken to reduce 
students' costs in as many ways as reasonably possible. Therefore, we 
request your urgent action on this matter.
 
Given the urgency of the matter, we are actively planning to base our 
future textbook orders on both the quality of the text and on the 
fairness of the text's price. We will also give strong consideration 
to the industry member who produces the first online version of this 
textbook. Given the high quality of your particular text, we hope 
that we can continue a relationship with your company for many years 
to come.
 
Sincerely,
