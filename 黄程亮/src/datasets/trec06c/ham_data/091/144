   Not that I can think of, DMDX is running on literally hundreds of XP 
machines and this is the first time we've come across something like this 
unless you've got some really nasty hardware in there.  Total lock ups of 
XP are difficult to achieve without some underlying driver failure so check 
what video card you have and see if there are new drivers for it.  If 
you've got another video card you might want to try it.  If it's not that 
given that it's happened to several of your machines I'd be suspecting 
something that you've got running on the machines, an anti-virus or some 
such thing.  Perhaps it's a configuration issue, maybe you've got a 
multi-monitor machine and the desktop isn't enabled on the second 
display.  Maybe you've got some really bizarre input configuration that I 
never imagined was possible but to probe any further I'll have to cook up a 
passpoints version of DMDX and get you to email me (not the list) the 
resulting file that will hopefully not get splattered when you shut the 
machine down.
