   No trouble.  I would use the time between the output codes to measure 
the retrace duration as they could easily be +/- 1.5ms.  If you've got a 
really nice machine it will be less.

   No, that functionality was dropped a few years ago and under 2000 or XP 
it would be impossible without writing WDM drivers which I'm not about to 
do.  Interface cards cost $90.

We can defeat gravity.  The problem is the paperwork involved.
