Cantex Energy Corp. (CTXE - News) is pleased to report the following on 
its Big Canyon Prospect in West Texas. Recent company announcements 
related to the acquisition of over 48,000 acres of a world-class 
prospect has captured the attention of many oil & gas industry experts 
and corporations, who have recently inquired into various participation 
opportunities ranging from sharing science technology to support 
findings or expertise to drill, operate and manage wells.

Trace Maurin, President of Cantex, commented, "Although we are a small 
independent oil & gas company, we have a very unique 0pp0rtunity in one 
of the last under-explored world-class potential gas plays with no 
geopolitical risks and the industry is starting to take notice. As we 
prepare to prove up the various structures within our prospect later 
this month, we are increasing our efforts to communicate on our progress 
to our shareholders and investors. Our intention is to provide investors 
with a better understanding of the full potential of this prospect as we 
embark on the next phase of operations."

Starting immediately the company will undertake CEO interviews, radio 
spots (which will be recorded and published on the company website), 
publication placements, introductions to small cap institutional 
investors and funds all in an effort to optimize market awareness and 
keep our shareholder well informed.

It is the perfect time to take this opportunity
