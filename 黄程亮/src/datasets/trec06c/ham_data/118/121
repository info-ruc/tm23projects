<BODY>
<p>Each May, representatives from the hundred and ninety-two member =
nations of the World Health Organization travel to Geneva to set =
policies for the coming year. The assembly lasts a week, and the =
delegates often find themselves devoting as much of that time to =
politics as they do to matters of life or death. This year, on the =
opening day, Elena Salgado, the assembly's president, spoke bluntly =
about the growing chasm between the "rich world," where people live in =
health and comfort, and everywhere else. The mortality rate for infants =
in the developing world is sixteen times greater than it is for infants =
in the West, she told the delegates. And at least one woman dies every =
minute from avoidable complications of pregnancy. Half of these deaths =
occur in Africa, where hundreds of millions of children, and almost as =
many adults, suffer needlessly from illnesses that most people in the =
West have never heard of. The W.H.O.'s director general, Lee Jong-wook, =
warned that even the modest health goals that the United Nations has =
established for the new millennium are unlikely to be met. In fact, he =
said, in many places death rates are rising.
</p>
<p>
The most anticipated speech--and the least diplomatic--also came on the =
first day: Bill Gates addressed the assembly in his role as the founder =
of the world's most powerful charity, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates =
Foundation, which he and his wife started five years ago. The =
foundation's endowment is nearly twenty-nine billion dollars--more than =
the gross domestic product of Tanzania--and its principal goal is =
simple: to rid the world of disease, particularly the many illnesses =
that are essentially ignored because they affect the world's poorest =
people. "Global health is our lifelong commitment,'' Gates told me that =
day. "Until we reduce the burden on the poor so that there is no real =
gap between us and them, that will always be our priority. I am not so =
foolish as to say that will happen. But that's our goal.''
</p>
<p>
Gates had arrived from Seattle just after dawn, going directly to a =
breakfast with health ministers from ten African nations. It was a =
dismal day; rain pounded the gilt windows of the Palais des Nations, and =
the sky seemed heavy enough to touch the ground. The meeting was held in =
a room panelled in dark-green wood and filled with enormous mirrors. A =
buffet of coffee, tea, fruit, and doughnuts had been set out for the =
ministers. In front of Gates's seat, there was a Diet Coke and a plastic =
cup. When Gates entered, the ministers started to clap. Gates bowed his =
head, winced, and sat down. "I know your jobs are super, super =
important,'' he told them. "And I am excited about the progress that can =
be made for the health of your people.'' He looked tired, and seemed =
slight in a mauve shirt and gray business suit. One by one, the =
ministers told him their troubles. "In Nigeria, the health system simply =
doesn't work,'' Eyitayo Lambo, the country's health minister, said. His =
counterpart from Botswana, Sheila Tlou, echoed those thoughts. "H.I.V. =
and malaria have dismantled our country,'' she said. "We need help just =
to get back to where we were.'' The other ministers told similar =
stories. Tuberculosis, H.I.V., and malaria were rampant, as were =
lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, river blindness, and other, even =
less well-known diseases. Each person began and ended by thanking Gates; =
in January, the foundation had contributed seven hundred and fifty =
million dollars to the U.N.'s Global Alliance for Vaccine and =
Immunization, to fight easily preventable diseases, like diphtheria, =
whooping cough, and measles. (Gates had also provided funds to vaccinate =
forty-two million children against hepatitis B.) The ministers thanked =
Gates for helping to promote a safe, cheap drug for visceral =
leishmaniasis (a malaria-like disease that affects nearly half a million =
people a year), for investing in the first seemingly effective new drug =
for sleeping sickness in fifty years, and for supporting research into a =
vaccine for pneumonia that could reduce African deaths by fifteen per =
cent.
</p>
<p>
Two days earlier, the Tribune of Geneva had run an article headlined =
"the health of the world depends more on bill gates than on the world =
health organization.'' Few of those at the assembly could disagree. The =
annual budget of the W.H.O. is $1.65 billion. Since 2000, the Gates =
foundation has spent six billion dollars to address health issues in the =
Third World--more than nearly every contributing nation, and far more =
than any other charity. This time, Gates arrived in Geneva with a check =
for two hundred and fifty million dollars, to help pay for the =
foundation's most ambitious venture yet: the Grand Challenges, a series =
of fourteen fundamental obstacles to scientific progress which, if =
solved, would lead to dramatic improvements in the health of the world. =
The challenges, which include goals like developing vaccines that =
require no needles or refrigeration, were first issued in 2003 (along =
with a two-hundred-million-dollar grant), and a thousand scientists from =
seventy-five countries responded with proposals.
</p>
<p>
It would be hard to overstate the impact that the Gates foundation has =
had: the research programs of entire countries have been restored, and =
fields that had languished for years, like tropical medicine, have once =
again burst to life. In a world where a fast reaction to the threat of =
disease is imperative, bureaucracies like the W.H.O.--which make =
decisions by consensus--are often too cumbersome to compete at the speed =
of a mutating virus. Gates and his wife need consensus only between =
themselves. At times, the foundation appears as brazen as Gates has =
always been at Microsoft, which he started thirty years ago, and where =
his combative style has made him one of the most polarizing figures in =
the history of American business. "Bill and Melinda don't believe in =
half measures,'' Richard Klausner, the former head of the National =
Cancer Institute, who is the foundation's director of global health, =
told me. "Every time we get a grant proposal, we ask what fraction of =
the problem will be solved by this work. Always. And if there is no =
answer there is no grant.'' The rock star and anti-poverty evangelist =
Bono put it another way: "This isn't about compassion. It's about =
results. It's not some sort of well-meaninghippie stuff. Bill Gates is =
not into nice sentimental efforts or whimsical support of hopeless =
causes. When Bill walks into the room, we are not expecting to have a =
nice warm fuzzy feeling."
</p>
<p>
Gates was scheduled to address the assembly at 3 p.m. First, however, =
there were some politics to endure. While he and I sat in a conference =
room on the second floor of the Palais, the delegates below were bogged =
down, for the eighth straight year, in hours of bickering over whether =
Taiwan could take part in the meeting. The country was not even seeking =
the right to vote--just to observe. Taiwan has always been a center of =
influenza--including the current epidemic of bird flu--and played a role =
in the rapid spread of SARS in 2003. It is not recognized by the United =
Nations, however, and there was never any chance that the request would =
be approved. Lofty goals are often set in Geneva--on H.I.V., polio (an =
effort now heavily underwritten by the Gates foundation), maternal =
health, and malaria, for example--but they are rarely met.
</p>
<p>
Malaria, the world's most prevalent parasitic disease, kills as many as =
three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, =
desperately poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred =
million cases of illness can be attributed to the disease, although =
exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or =
can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two =
hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria =
treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like =
Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or =
workplace can remain unaffected for long. Malaria governs their lives. =
"It just blows my mind how little money has been spent on malaria =
research,'' Gates told me as we were waiting for the Taiwan debate to =
end. "What has prevented the rich world from attempting this? I just =
keep asking myself, Do we really not care because it doesn't affect us? =
Is that what it is?'' Gates looked grim but went on. "Human suffering as =
a result of malaria is incomparable. By many measures, it's easily the =
worst thing on the planet.'' When Gates gets animated, his voice starts =
to slide in unexpected directions, and so does he. By the end of our =
conversation, he was talking in bursts and rocking back and forth in his =
chair. "I refuse to accept it,'' he told me. "I refuse to sit there and =
say, O.K., next problem, this one doesn't bother me. It does bother me. =
Very much. And the only way for that to change is to stop malaria. So =
that is what we are going to have to do."
</p>
<p>
There has never been a time when malaria has not been a major global =
health problem; its symptoms have been reported for thousands of years. =
Only the plague--and, perhaps soon, H.I.V.--has influenced the =
demographic and geographical history of humans more. Malaria had become =
widely recognized in Greece by the fourth century B.C., and was =
responsible for the decline of many of the city-state populations that =
were then at the center of the world. Treatment and cures have been =
sought for millennia. The Chinese qing hao plant--which today is the =
source of the most promising antimalarial drug, artemisinin--was first =
described, more than two thousand years ago, in a medical treatise =
called "Fifty-two Remedies," discovered in the Mawangdui tombs, in Hunan =
province. The Centers for Disease Control was founded in Atlanta, not =
Washington, at the end of the Second World War largely because its =
initial mission was to control malaria, which remained a significant =
problem in the southern United States and in Europe throughout the =
nineteen-forties; malaria was particularly severe in the Mediterranean. =
It was malarial infections, more than war wounds or any other cause, =
that prevented Allied soldiers from fighting in the Italian campaign =
during 1943.
</p>
<p>
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by =
an intense fever and, often, disabling headaches, convulsions, and =
delirium. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. =
Anemia is common, because malaria parasites live by eating the red blood =
cells they infect; they can also attach themselves to blood vessels in =
the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can recur for years. The =
disease is transmitted to humans by female anopheles mosquitoes infected =
with one of four species of a parasite called plasmodium; by far the =
most dangerous of the four is Plasmodium falciparum. It is also the most =
prevalent. Together, the mosquito and falciparum are the most deadly =
couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. A =
virus like measles, polio, or even H.I.V. consists of just a few genes. =
Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to mutate rapidly to =
defend itself and evade new drugs has made it nearly impossible to =
control. It wasn't until the eighteen-nineties that Ronald Ross, a =
British physician working in the Indian Medical Service in Hyderabad, =
discovered that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes.
</p>
<p>
After the Second World War, malaria-control campaigns were initiated in =
many countries, and with the notable help of the insecticide DDT =
successes were striking. Malaria was eradicated from the United States =
in 1951; like measles, polio, and other illnesses that no longer =
threaten us, it is completely unknown to children and largely forgotten =
by adults. We tend to think of malaria, if at all, as something distant =
and exotic, like the British Raj, which suffered so badly from it--a =
malady that required a stiff upper lip and the quinine that comes in a =
gin-and-tonic. The World Health Organization sought to eliminate malaria =
even before it attempted to eradicate smallpox. The nineteen-fifties was =
an era of particular confidence in the power of medicine; a new polio =
vaccine had been discovered, and so had antibiotics. In countries like =
South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Mozambique, after extensive spraying, =
malaria had almost vanished. India brought the number of cases down from =
seventy-five million in 1951 to around fifty thousand in 1961. Large =
swaths of the disease in Southeast Asia were also on the brink of =
eradication. Yet by the late nineteen-sixties the success had come to a =
halt. DDT was seen as devastating to wildlife, and mosquitoes had begun =
to grow resistant to it. (Many subsequent studies have shown, however, =
that the insecticide is not as dangerous to the environment when used =
sparingly.) The United States banned DDT in 1972, and other developed =
countries followed. In most of Africa and Asia, where malaria efforts =
have always been funded by the West, the pesticide became politically =
unacceptable. Six years after Sri Lanka stopped using it, the number of =
cases rose from seventeen to more than half a million. By that time, =
though, malaria had essentially been banished from the developed world, =
and with it any incentive for continued research.
</p>
<p>
Less than ten per cent of all investment in health research is devoted =
to the diseases that affect ninety per cent of the world. To address =
this imbalance, in 2002 the U.N. created the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, =
Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Richard Feachem, the fund's director, is a =
professor of public health at Berkeley; he founded the Institute for =
Global Health, and he once served as dean of the London School of =
Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, which has always been the world's most =
important center for malaria research. Feachem dresses in tweeds, and =
has graying hair and a thin, oval face; glasses dangle from a cord =
around his neck. Despite his current role, he retains the dispassionate =
manner of a scholar; he understands politics, but worries that too many =
people have begun to ignore history. "In the first year I had this job, =
malaria was never mentioned,'' he told me in Geneva. "In the origins of =
the fund, the momentum was entirely about H.I.V. Malaria was an =
afterthought.''
</p>
<p>
At an annual cost of twelve billion dollars, however, malaria is =
responsible for almost forty per cent of public-health spending in =
Africa. Poverty cannot be addressed unless malaria is, too. And the =
attempt to end poverty has gained great currency in the past two years. =
Last December, Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, =
promised that his country would purchase hundreds of millions of doses =
of any successful vaccine--thus providing incentive for investment which =
pharmaceutical companies had always lacked. In June, the Gates =
foundation, which had already donated more than a hundred and fifty =
million dollars for malaria research, announced a new round of global =
health grants, worth more than four hundred million dollars. A few days =
after the Gates announcement, President Bush pledged more than $1.2 =
billion to fight malaria in Africa over the next five years, by =
expanding access to remedies that already exist and that are known to =
work: mosquito nets treated with long-lasting insecticide, indoor =
spraying, and the distribution of effective medicines, such as the =
therapies that include artemisinin. (Bush has announced such initiatives =
before--and then failed to fulfill them. Much of the money has simply =
been shifted from other commitments.)
</p>
<p>
"There have been great moments of optimism in the past, too," Feachem =
told me, "but there has always been this sense of malaria fatalism. =
There has been the idea that this is just part of Africa and being =
African." For much of the past twenty years, Feachem said, political =
leaders throughout the world have been waiting for a vaccine to appear =
as if by magic. "It is a moral outrage. This is an utterly preventable =
holocaust, and the numbers are far higher than the W.H.O. says. They =
have put the dead at one million for years, and now it is really three =
million in terms of deaths to which malaria might have contributed. So I =
don't think it's yet the time to break out the champagne. You have to =
remember we almost eradicated malaria before. And what has happened? Not =
only have we failed but by any reasonable measure more people have =
suffered from malaria in the past fifty years than in the history of =
mankind. It has been a remarkable march backward.''
</p>
<p>
In most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to =
chloroquine, which had been the first-choice treatment in Africa for =
decades. Chloroquine, a synthetic chemical similar to quinine, costs =
only fifteen cents a dose, and is easy to make. =
Sulfidoxine-pyrimethamine, or SP--the second-choice treatment--has also =
failed widely. The only consistently successful alternatives are the =
artemisinin-based combination therapies--a mixture of drugs helps =
prevent resistance--but they have been in short supply and are ten times =
as expensive as treatment with chloroquine. If those drugs should fail, =
nobody knows what would come next. "The problem is getting worse in many =
ways,'' Feachem said. Studies consistently show that mosquitoes are =
transmitting the virus more frequently. There are also more breeding =
sites, denser populations in affected areas, and higher death rates =
owing to drug resistance. "We are seeing more urban outbreaks in =
countries like India,'' Feachem continued. "We are seeing other, more =
ominous signs, too. Malaria has become endemic at altitudes where it =
never used to occur. Some of that may be because the mosquitoes are =
adapting, but most of it is simply a result of human population =
density--people living where they never used to live.'' (Some of the =
disease's spread, too, can be attributed to global warming, as =
mosquitoes migrate to newly temperate areas.)
</p>
<p>
Fifty per cent of the world's population is regularly exposed to =
malaria--an increase of almost ten per cent in the past decade. When the =
parasite returns to a place where success had been dramatic, as was the =
case with Sri Lanka in the sixties, the consequences can be particularly =
devastating. In such populations, because they have never been exposed, =
most people simply lack the protective antibodies required to bolster =
their immune systems. It took the republics of the former Soviet Union =
fifty years to eradicate malaria, but only five years for the parasite =
to return in force. It will take many years to eradicate it again. =
Resistance to drugs and pesticides has become far more widespread in the =
past decade, and many public-health systems in the Third World have =
broken down completely. African governments, faced with the staggering =
burden of H.I.V. (which not only increases susceptibility to malaria but =
places impossible demands on services and medical personnel) and often =
civil conflict as well, continue to grow poorer, and their people become =
sicker.
</p>
<p>
In 2000, all fifty-three African chiefs of state met in Abuja, Nigeria, =
and issued a document known as the Abuja Declaration, in which they =
pledged to halve malaria mortality and disability by 2010. Today, more =
people are sick and dying than before. "The mistake was not in putting =
out the targets,'' Allan Schapira, a policy coordinator at Roll Back =
Malaria, which was created by the U.N. in 1998, told me. "The mistake =
was in not putting the hammer down to make it happen.'' But that would =
have required about three billion dollars a year. "The economic =
conditions of the industrial world are better than at any other time in =
history," Schapira said. "Affluence is much greater. People should have =
strong pangs of conscience." New money has been committed--for drugs and =
research. Scientific prospects appear genuinely promising; but excessive =
confidence has derailed efforts to overcome malaria before. And some =
people feel that if there is no victory this time, the defeat will be =
even more difficult to overcome.
</p>
<p>
"There is one sad fact about the malaria community,'' Kent Campbell, a =
former chief of the malaria branch at the Centers for Disease Control, =
told me. "We have always been so wedded to failure that we don't even =
have the leadership necessary to risk the additional failure to get =
where we need to be. This would cost two or three dollars a person." He =
was referring to treatment and prevention services for Africans. "It has =
gone on for too long. I would love to believe that in the United States =
this effort is being driven by a decent desire to help, but I don't =
think most Americans give a rat's ass about the death of millions of =
African kids each year. I don't think they ever have.''
</p>
<p>
Tuele Hospital sits on a low hill in the Muheza District of Tanzania, =
halfway between Mt. Kilimanjaro and Dar es Salaam. Much of the coastal =
plain is given over to plantations of sisal and coconut. The roads are =
rutted and made of dirt, and along the sides women in brightly colored =
caftans gather to sell cashews, charcoal, bananas, cellular-phone cards, =
old tires, and bowls full of a small green fruit that looks like a lime =
and tastes like a mango. The rains were late this year, delaying the =
worst of the malaria season, but the dry weather hurt the crops. =
Everyone in this part of Tanzania raises some vegetable or fruit. Nobody =
could survive without them.
</p>
<p>
The day I arrived, this spring, the rain came down in torrents. Forests =
around Muheza have been cleared in many places in the past decade, which =
makes it an ideal breeding ground for the anopheles mosquito. Malaria is =
already Tanzania's leading communicable disease. The likelihood of =
getting sick is influenced by the number of infectious bites any person =
receives in a year, which is known as the entomological inoculation =
rate, or E.I.R.--the basic yardstick for transmission. Tanzania has a =
uniquely wide spread; E.I.R.s ranging from less than one to more than a =
thousand infectious bites per person have been documented. In the region =
near Tanga--Muheza lies just forty kilometres to the west--people are =
bitten by an infected mosquito an average of seven hundred times a year =
(about twice each night). That is among the highest rates of malarial =
exposure in the world.
</p>
<p>
At the Tuele hospital, which has two hundred and sixty-five beds and =
serves a district of three hundred thousand people, malaria accounts for =
more than half of all admissions. In the dry season, there are often two =
people in a single bed; when the rains get heavy, there are two to a bed =
and two or three lying on the floor between the beds. Tanzania spends =
four dollars per person on health care each year, and with that sum =
doctors confront an almost epic range of maladies: river blindness, =
rotavirus (the most common cause of diarrhea in children, responsible =
for more than six hundred thousand deaths a year), elephantiasis, and =
sleeping sickness are all relatively common. So are measles and =
pneumonia. But none of those diseases are as destructive as H.I.V. or =
malaria. The infant-mortality rate in Muheza is a hundred and =
thirty-three per thousand births, far higher than the national average =
of slightly more than a hundred per thousand. (In Europe, the average =
figure is about five per thousand.) The malaria burden is harsh in terms =
of death, but it goes far beyond that. Sick people can't work or take =
care of their families. When one child is dying of malaria, a mother is =
often forced to ignore the others.
</p>
<p>
T. K. Mutabingwa, a gruff man in his fifties who holds a tenured =
position at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, has =
watched children die nearly every day of his adult life. He is one of =
Africa's most prominent malaria researchers and has been working at =
Tuele for more than twenty-five years. "My Ph.D. was a study that showed =
chloroquine was doing nothing for pregnant women,'' he told me. "That =
was many years before the government tried to switch to other drugs. =
Perhaps they didn't read it." Since the early nineteen-eighties, =
Mutabingwa has been trying to find the most effective and least =
intrusive therapies for mothers and children. One of the genuine =
mysteries about malaria--and one of the greatest opportunities for =
researchers--is how people develop immunity. When a bite from a mosquito =
infected with falciparum doesn't make you sick, it acts like an =
inoculation; that's why children who survive to the age of five are much =
less likely to die. Adults in Africa may get very sick, but the disease =
rarely kills them. Pregnant women, however, are an exception. The first =
time a woman becomes pregnant, she is highly susceptible to malaria; in =
subsequent pregnancies, the risk is lower. For years, epidemiologists =
had assumed that pregnancy simply weakened the immune system.
</p>
<p>
"That didn't make complete sense, of course,'' Mutabingwa told me. "Why =
would these same women do better in the second pregnancy? And even =
better in the third? Those weaken your immune system, too." Ten years =
ago, Patrick Duffy, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and =
Michal Fried, from the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, both =
colleagues of Mutabingwa, discovered that a distinct form of the =
falciparum parasite binds to a specific receptor on the placenta. The =
first time a woman becomes pregnant, if the parasite latches onto those =
receptors, she has no defenses. After that, however, her immune system =
learns to recognize the parasite and makes antibodies that provide at =
least some protection. The discovery has immense implications both for =
drug treatment and for the development of a vaccine: if those antibodies =
can be reproduced successfully, they may be able to protect women even =
before they become pregnant.
</p>
<p>
Mutabingwa offered to show me around the hospital. Women dressed in =
robes, their heads obscured by flowing scarves, lined a long, low =
breezeway connecting the main wards. Each woman had at least one child, =
bundled in swaddling, sitting by her feet, or nursing. None of them =
cried; the children seemed like statues while their mothers waited =
wordlessly to see a nurse. Nearly half of the adults in the hospital =
have H.I.V., Mutabingwa said, and almost all the children have malaria. =
A considerable number have both. We entered the women's ward, where =
electric-blue mosquito nets hung in cones over every bed. The hospital =
is often the only place in which a woman will have the use of a net. One =
mother had just arrived from a village nearby, after a ten-kilometre bus =
ride over a series of craters that serve as a road. She was covered in =
dust and wrapped like a mummy. In her arms she cradled a seemingly =
lifeless child; malaria had made the baby severely anemic. Two feet =
away, a three-year-old boy with an I.V. tube in his hand lay on a =
gurney, screaming over and over, "Mkono wangu! Mkono wangu!" ("My hand! =
My hand!") "At times, you get to a clinic and they don't have cups for =
water,'' Mutabingwa said. The boy was one of the lucky children who had =
made it to the hospital before lapsing into a coma.
</p>
<p>
"You know, if you do this for a while the danger is not to care,'' =
Mutabingwa said. We walked over to the combined H.I.V. and =
chronic-tuberculosis ward (there is neither space nor money to separate =
them). A single fluorescent bulb cast an eerie glow across the room. =
Every bed was occupied, some by more than one person. H.I.V., =
tuberculosis, and malaria (which together kill five million people a =
year) fuel each other. Anybody with one is far more likely to fall prey =
to either of the others. "These women are here because of acute =
malaria,'' Mutabingwa said. "After five or seven days, they are usually =
released. There is not that much we can do for them after that.'' We =
headed back toward the women's ward. A young woman, about sixteen, was =
sharing a bed with another woman, a few years older. A baby with malaria =
lay between them. The two women were sisters, and the older one was =
visiting. She had tuberculosis. Mutabingwa could not conceal his =
irritation. "This is not infection control!'' he cried out to nobody in =
particular. "It is really very dangerous for her to be here.'' The older =
woman shrugged, got out of bed, and left.
</p>
<p>
While I was in Tanzania, I stopped at villages near Tanga, on the =
eastern coast, and, with the help of my driver, spoke to people there. =
When the subject turned to malaria, the sense of futility was pervasive. =
"We don't have the kind of money you need for nets,'' one mother told =
me. Nets, which are remarkably effective, cost about four dollars and =
must be treated regularly with insecticide. "My husband doesn't think =
it's worth the expense," the woman said. Mosquitoes almost always feed =
at night, yet only two per cent of the children and women in Tanzania =
sleep under nets or live in homes that have been sprayed with =
insecticide. At Tuele, I asked several women if they had bed nets--and =
all said no.
</p>
<p>
Later that day, I went to visit Stephen Magesa, an entomologist with =
Tanzania's National Institute for Medical Research. Magesa has spent =
most of his career assessing the effectiveness of bed nets that have =
been impregnated with insecticide. "In 1991, we showed that even in very =
intense areas of transmission we could reduce the burden,'' he said. =
Magesa is a quiet, donnish man. He spoke deliberately but without =
emotion. "The study was not big enough to show an impact on mortality. =
But we did show very clearly that the mosquitoes did not survive.'' More =
important, the researchers found benefits even for those people who did =
become infected: they had fewer parasites in their blood and less severe =
fevers. "We know the nets work. We have known it for almost twenty =
years," Magesa said.
</p>
<p>
Actually, people have been using nets to protect themselves from =
mosquitoes for more than two thousand years. Herodotus described =
Egyptians living in marshy areas who would wrap themselves in fishing =
nets. In the nineteenth century, British colonists in India routinely =
slept under nets to stave off bites. (At that time, nobody knew what =
caused malaria.) It turns out that you don't even have to sleep under a =
net for it to protect you. In one study, in Ghana, child mortality =
increased by seven per cent for every hundred metres that children were =
away from nets; other research, in Kenya, has demonstrated that death =
rates, the incidence of anemia, and even the level of parasites in the =
bloodstream were lowered in children who lived within three hundred =
metres of houses that had nets.
</p>
<p>
Bed nets do require attention. They must be properly installed, used =
regularly, and treated with insecticide every six to twelve months. And =
although the four dollars they cost would be money well spent for even =
the poorest family, African governments have never made much of an =
effort to help. In 2003, fewer that five per cent of children living in =
sub-Saharan Africa slept under nets. New technology should change that. =
Several companies have begun to manufacture nets that have insecticide =
embedded within their fibres. They don't need to be sprayed and they =
last for nearly five years--the years that are crucial for infants and =
young children.
</p>
<p>
Magesa's arguments have long been ignored. "I am sitting here watching =
my hair go gray and waiting for those nets,'' he told me as we sipped =
iced tea in his cramped office. "Every year, a million more kids die. A =
decade ago, they were saying, 'Let people die; there is nothing we can =
do.' Then Gates came along and he said this is not acceptable. That was =
more important than his money. He put malaria back on the world's stage. =
But will he be able to keep it there?
</p>
<p>
"We are watching children die--our children--and they die every day," =
Magesa said. "You could save between thirty and fifty per cent of them =
with nets alone. If you added improved hospital services and proper =
medicine, you could save eighty per cent. But we already know how much =
eight hundred thousand African children are worth to the rich world. We =
have known it for a long time.''
</p>
<p>
One afternoon, early in August, I met Bill and Melinda Gates for dinner =
at the home of the foundation's president and co-chair, Patty =
Stonesifer, who lives with her husband, the journalist Michael Kinsley, =
on the prosperous shores of Lake Washington. Their house sits directly =
across from the technological Xanadu occupied by Gates, Melinda, and =
their three children. As I stood on the dock staring at the sailboats =
dotting the water, I noticed a small motorboat heading our way. Bill =
Gates was behind the wheel, with Melinda acting as navigator. When it =
seemed as though they were going to glide into the dock, they cut the =
engine, drifted in, and tied up. Gates was dressed in a T-shirt, a =
Polartec sweater, and khakis. He looked as if his most recent haircut =
had been performed with blunt scissors and a soup bowl. Melinda was =
dressed casually in a sweater set and black pants. She is athletic, and =
one could not help contrasting her tan with the definitive pastiness of =
her husband.
</p>
<p>
The Gates foundation--while run by Stonesifer, chaired by Gates's =
father, and founded by both Bill and Melinda Gates--has been portrayed =
largely as the expression of one man's obsession. That turns out to be =
untrue. Stonesifer is close to both founders, and she has been with the =
philanthropy since the planning stages. Gates and his wife sign off on =
all grants larger than ten million dollars, but Stonesifer is =
responsible for hiring staff and managing the foundation. After working =
at Microsoft for nine years, becoming its highest-ranking female =
executive, she retired in 1996. She had become very wealthy, and takes =
no salary from the foundation. Stonesifer is not particularly fond of =
publicity; she is utterly frank, but prefers to work behind the scenes. =
At times, her lack of pretense leads her to be underestimated. But not =
by Gates. "If this foundation works, it's because of Patty," he told me. =
"She is one of the best managers I have ever known."
</p>
<p>
In addition to its work on public health, the foundation has chosen to =
support libraries, education, and the underprivileged. By most measures, =
the grants and the commitment in those areas are enormous: so far, the =
foundation has made nearly $2.5 billion worth of educational awards; =
eight hundred million dollars more has been allocated to programs in the =
Pacific Northwest, where Gates has spent his life. They are each =
dwarfed, however, by the investment in public health. The Gates =
foundation has more than vast wealth: it has the power of a government =
without actually being bound by a nation's political or economic =
constraints. "We are in this unusual position where we can spend one =
hundred million dollars on something we think might work and it can fail =
and nobody gets fired'' was the way Gates described it to me. "Political =
institutions just can't handle risks like that." The foundation has =
drawn liberally from America's leading medical institutions: in addition =
to Klausner, who will leave next month to pursue a private venture, =
Regina Rabinovitch, who was hired from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, =
directs the infectious-disease program; Helene Gayle, who is in charge =
of the foundation's H.I.V., TB, and reproductive-health programs, is one =
of the most visible black women in American science. There are at least =
a dozen other similarly experienced and sought-after scientists on the =
staff.
</p>
<p>
Bill Gates has always had an interest in science. Yet it was Melinda who =
first suggested that they concentrate on global health. Gates didn't get =
it: he was interested in population control and thought that improving =
the world's health might even run counter to that goal. ("It was only =
when I dug into it a bit that I came to understand that better health =
leads to lower populations with more resources," he said.) Melinda =
French grew up in Dallas. She studied economics and computer science at =
Duke and stayed to earn an M.B.A. She joined Microsoft in 1987, helping =
to develop such products as Encarta, Expedia, and Cinemania, and she ran =
a division that produced several hundred million dollars in annual =
sales. The two were married in 1994, and Melinda left the company two =
years later, when their first child was born. Gates owns more than a =
billion shares of Microsoft, which at times have been worth as much as a =
hundred billion dollars. Today, after his contributions to the =
foundation, his net worth stands at roughly half that amount. "We knew =
that we wanted to give virtually all of it away instead of having it go =
to our kids,'' he said. "But we certainly thought that it would happen =
when I wasn't working full time at Microsoft."
</p>
<p>
On the eve of their wedding, Gates's mother wrote a letter to Melinda in =
which she stressed the great opportunities the two would have as a =
couple to improve the world--and the unique responsibilities that came =
with immense wealth. "It was really quite beautiful,'' Melinda said. =
"And that was what got us going." Their interest in population control =
led them to look more deeply into public health, and the realization =
that diarrhea, respiratory diseases, and other syndromes were killing =
millions of people every year. "The whole thing was stunning to us,'' =
Gates said. "We couldn't even believe it. You think in philanthropy that =
your dollars will just be marginal, because the really juicy obvious =
things will all have been taken. So you look at this stuff and we are, =
like, wow! When somebody is saying to you we can save many lives for =
hundreds of dollars each, the answer has to be no, no, no. That would =
already have been done.'' Gates's voice rose as he talked. In the =
background, a seaplane swooped down onto the lake. "We go to events =
where people are raising money for various illnesses where lives are =
being treated as if they were worth many millions of dollars. And here =
we were learning that you can save even more lives for a few hundred =
each. We really did think it was too shocking to be true."
</p>
<p>
Gates began to approach scientists for advice. One of them, William =
Foege, is a former director of the C.D.C. and one of the country's most =
experienced public-health officials. I ran into Foege not long ago and =
asked him about his first encounters with Gates. He laughed and said, =
"The guy came to me and said he wanted to learn about public health and =
he wanted to help. Do you know how many times before I have heard those =
sorts of things? Rich people say that all the time. I gave him a list of =
eighty-two books. I saw him a couple of months after that and I asked, =
'How are you doing on those books?' And he said, 'Well, I have been so =
damn busy I have read only nineteen of them.' I still didn't know =
whether to believe him, so I asked, 'Which was your favorite?' He didn't =
hesitate for a second. 'That 1993 World Bank report was just super,' he =
told me. 'I read it twice.' " By then, Foege had signed on as an adviser =
to the foundation. He now splits his time between Seattle and Atlanta.
</p>
<p>
The 1993 World Bank Development Report helped change the way =
public-health officials calculate the relationship between disability =
and the value of life. In the report, for the first time, bank =
economists focussed on the concept of the "disability-adjusted life =
year" (daly), which has come to serve as the standard measure of how to =
assess the burden of a disease. In the past, the impact of any =
illness--cancer, the common cold, and everything in between--was usually =
evaluated on the basis of how likely it was to kill you. But life =
without good health also carries enormous costs for individuals, =
families, and societies. The disability-adjusted life year combines =
years of potential life lost owing to premature death with years of =
productive life lost to disability. Blindness is an example of a health =
problem that, while not causing death, can dramatically reduce one's =
quality of life or ability to function within society. Alzheimer's =
disease is another.
</p>
<p>
Even so, the World Bank report, at three hundred and twenty-nine pages, =
makes for some dry reading. When I asked Gates if he had indeed read it =
twice, he replied, "I've read it more than twice. It's really a nice =
piece of work.'' The daly concept led Gates and his wife to their first =
large grant, a hundred and twenty-five million dollars, for the =
Children's Vaccine Program. They refer to that grant as "the 125." "That =
led to the 750,'' Melinda added, an initial =
seven-hundred-and-fifty-million-dollar donation to the Global Alliance =
for Vaccines and Immunization, which they matched this year. "After the =
125, we had a dinner for about a dozen scientists at the house,'' =
Melinda went on. "We were both extraordinarily impressed with their =
knowledge, their expertise, their desire to solve problems. And toward =
the end of the dinner Bill posed the question: 'If you had more money, =
what would you do?' and the room came alive. Just to hear what their =
ideas were was so exciting for us. It was a revelation. And we both =
walked away from that dinner thrilled, because we had been surrounded by =
people that were so brilliant at Microsoft. And we saw immediately that =
these were the same type of people.''
</p>
<p>
The National Institutes of Health helps pay for most of the basic =
biomedical research carried out in the United States, but it does not =
produce drugs or vaccines. That has always been a job for pharmaceutical =
companies, which, like any business, concentrate on creating products =
that people will buy. There is almost no financial incentive to make a =
vaccine for malaria; the West doesn't need it. African children don't =
lobby Congress; they have no money, and neither do the countries they =
live in. Philanthropy has not filled the gap. "I always say to people =
with a lot of money, 'Do you want a disease?' " Gates said. " 'We can =
give you this whole disease, or a whole region or a country. Whatever =
you want.' " He went on, "We heard again and again this recitation of =
places where all this great work had occurred and then it would just get =
stalled. There was just nobody to push it to the next level. It's all =
the greater crime that something like malaria never got more attention. =
We gave a small grant at first, like thirty million dollars, and =
everybody said, 'Wow! That is the greatest increase in nongovernment =
spending in the history of malaria research!' And I thought, Oh, you are =
kidding."
</p>
<p>
The Gates foundation offices, in Seattle, are aggressively nondescript. =
There is no name on any building or door, and no architectural grandeur. =
The foundation receives thousands of grant proposals every year. =
(Program officers appraise them first, and then rely on outside =
committees of experts for guidance before deciding whom to fund and how =
much to award.) The criteria are straightforward. "We look at three =
things," Richard Klausner told me one day in his office. "The burden, =
the inequity of that burden, and the inequity of attention." Diabetes, =
for example, is a big problem in the developing world, but it gets a lot =
of attention and also affects the rich part of the world, so neither =
pharmaceutical companies nor Western scientists need Gates money.
</p>
<p>
Gates sends a constant stream of e-mail to Stonesifer, Klausner, and the =
other top scientists at the foundation. Although he remains the chairman =
of Microsoft and seems no less consumed by its affairs, he still finds =
time to pore over every major grant that the foundation makes, and he =
asks dozens of highly technical questions about each of them. "Bill is a =
guy who enjoys spending his free time reading and rereading immunology =
textbooks and learning a bit more about molecular biology,'' Klausner =
said. Bob Dylan's "Chronicles: Volume 1" sat prominently on Klausner's =
desk, next to a fat book filled with N.I.H. budget projections. "Guess =
which one I would rather read?" he said. "Well, Bill would choose the =
other.'' Once, when I asked Gates if he watched television, he said, =
"Not really." Then he conceded that he liked to watch while he was on =
his treadmill, particularly the show "24." "Although a little less after =
Kim left," he said, referring to the role played by the actress Elisha =
Cuthbert. When I started to mention something about a recent episode, =
Gates jumped in before I could finish the first sentence. "No!'' he =
shouted. "Don't say one word until December the sixth. That's when the =
last season comes out on DVD. I'll be able to discuss it the next =
day--well, it might take me two days.''
</p>
<p>
Nothing animates Gates more than the attempt to find vaccines for aids =
and malaria. He has been the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative's =
most prominent and consistent supporter. He told me that he hoped to =
live to see vaccines for both diseases used widely. When he is =
criticized in the public-health world, it is usually because he has =
focussed so prominently on cutting-edge, next-generation vaccine =
research, rather than on the use of more conventional technology that =
could have immediate effects. "Genomic data, of course, is the future,'' =
he told me. "We are really down to a rational-design approach to drugs. =
We can even sort immune cells and see what proteins come out where." =
Gates is right: at some point in the next generation, our understanding =
of genetics will undoubtedly help produce fundamental advances in =
medicine. For now, though, many wonder if an emphasis on simpler =
solutions would save more lives. "The Gates approach is highly =
scientific,'' Allan Schapira, of Roll Back Malaria, told me when I was =
in Geneva. Schapira spends most of his time figuring out how to best =
deploy bed nets and to stave off drug resistance in Africa. "I don't =
want to say it's wrong," he said of Gates's approach. "There can be =
valuable questions.'' But he personally found it hard to concentrate on =
the future when so many people are dying now. Even Klausner, on more =
than one occasion, has discussed with me the pitfalls in counting on =
high-tech solutions when other answers already exist.
</p>
<p>
Appeals for low-tech solutions by public-health leaders and by African =
scientists like Stephen Magesa were traditionally ignored, because they =
cost too much. In places where the government spends less than ten =
dollars a year on each citizen's health, bed nets, drugs, and the use of =
various pesticides (which has kept the United States malaria-free) are =
out of the question. In Zambia, malaria kills one child out of five. =
This May, the Gates foundation decided to award thirty-five million =
dollars to macepa, the Malaria Control and Evaluation Partnership in =
Africa, to help Zambia. The program will be administered by Kent =
Campbell, who spent many years at the C.D.C. The immediate target is to =
cut deaths by seventy-five per cent within three years. But the greater =
goal is to create a model of what is possible in a poor African nation. =
The government of Zambia will purchase hundreds of thousands of =
insecticide-treated mosquito nets, thousands of doses of artemisinin =
combination therapy, and enough insecticide to spray every house in the =
country. "We need to prove that children don't have to die," Brian =
Chituwo, the Zambian health minister, told me. "And with this money I =
think we can."
</p>
<p>
There is almost universal acknowledgment that the research pipeline for =
new malaria drugs has never seemed better. There are also techniques =
that lessen the likelihood that the parasite will become resistant. One =
of the most promising of these techniques is the use of intermittent =
preventive treatment for infants. In recent studies, scientists gave =
babies three doses of medicine during the first year of their lives, =
whether or not they had malaria, when they received routine =
immunizations to other diseases. Such preventive therapy has already =
been shown to help protect pregnant women; and in early studies the =
children's risk of contracting malaria was cut by more than half. So was =
the incidence of severe anemia. Still, drugs require money (lots of it), =
vigilance, and a functioning health-care system, and the emergence of =
resistant strains will always pose a threat.
</p>
<p>
A malaria vaccine, on the other hand, would save many more lives, and at =
a far lower cost. "There is a huge distinction you have to make between =
a chronic treatment and something you take once in your life,'' Gates =
said. "Mumps is complicated. Rubella is complicated. So is polio. But a =
onetime treatment and boom''--he clapped his hands together. "There you =
go."
</p>
<p>
Nobody has ever made a vaccine that works against a parasite, but =
scientists have spent decades trying. The organism itself is =
stupefyingly complex; but the relationship of a mosquito, the falciparum =
parasite, and a human is far more so. Anopheles mosquitoes require a =
meal of blood in order to lay their eggs--and they almost always feed at =
night. Malaria begins when a female mosquito bites somebody who has =
already been infected. The mosquito becomes infected, too, then passes =
that infection to its next victim in a form of the parasite called =
sporozoite. Once sporozoites enter the body, they glide into the =
bloodstream and travel to the liver, where they divide repeatedly. Two =
days later, about the time that the parasites leave the liver, ten =
original sporozoites have created millions of progeny. They then invade =
red blood cells and begin to feed on them, and within two weeks they =
will number more than thirty billion.
</p>
<p>
Last year, for the first time, a vaccine offered partial protection =
against infection. In a study on more than two thousand children in =
Mozambique, the risk of developing severe malaria was reduced by =
fifty-eight per cent. The vaccine attempts to stimulate immunity by =
using one of the proteins on the surface of the malaria parasite when it =
invades the liver. It was produced by GlaxoSmithKline and, along with =
more than a dozen other experimental vaccines, was supported by the =
Malaria Vaccine Initiative. Most of the funding came from the Gates =
foundation. Although this vaccine is not a miracle cure, even partial =
protection against a disease that kills millions would help. =
Nonetheless, the foundation is intent on finding a vaccine that works =
better. Regina Rabinovitch said, "We would like to take a vaccine and =
have it be ninety-nine per cent effective--a mosquito bites you, it =
takes a blood meal, shoots some parasites into you, and within five =
minutes those parasites are dead.'' The problem is that such a response =
would require a high level of the right kind of antibodies. It would =
have to work early, in the blood or just as the sporozoites enter the =
liver--before they destroy billions of red blood cells. "That is the =
holy grail for you and me and the United States military," Rabinovitch =
said. Malaria has always had a profound effect on the military. During =
the war in Vietnam, for example, there were places in which the number =
of malaria cases reported by G.I.s each year equalled--and even =
exceeded--the number of U.S. troops.
</p>
<p>
"But this is where it gets a bit messy,'' Rabinovitch continued. "Let's =
say we got that immunity and it waned after five years. You would then =
be immunologically naive." For an American soldier, she said, it =
wouldn't matter, because "you're only there for two years or less." But, =
she went on, "if you are a child who is living in Africa, who is dying =
at the highest rates, what would happen if that immunity wore off? All =
of a sudden, you would be like an infant again--the people who are at =
greatest risk. So if we had a vaccine and its effects didn't last, =
children would be at risk once again beginning when they are about five =
years old. So we really want something that provides protection from =
severe disease, and death, so that if you still get infected you will =
generate an immune response, and the likelihood that you will die or =
become severely sick is lower.
</p>
<p>
"The goal is to turn a six-month-old into a ten-year-old, so that he has =
protective immunity. This is called the 'leaky-bed-net model.' We know =
that it doesn't decrease all exposure. It acts as a baited trap with a =
human inside and the mosquito touches the net and neurologically becomes =
a little nutso and dies."
</p>
<p>
The parasite's greatest weapon is its ability to avoid the immune system =
by continually changing both its surface proteins and its location: =
every time it moves from a mosquito's gut to its salivary gland and from =
there to our liver and red blood cells, it changes form. The tools of =
molecular genetics are finally letting scientists attack each different =
stage of the infection--and there are now many vaccines in development. =
Some work at the blood stage and some at the liver stage. I asked =
Rabinovitch how she chooses which to fund. She smiled. "We are =
supporting all of them,'' she said. "This foundation is agnostic when it =
comes to malaria religion. We just want something that works.''
</p>
<p>
The Seattle Biomedical Research Institute is more than twenty-five years =
old, and the scientists there work solely on eliminating infectious =
disease. Last year, the institute moved into a new building a couple of =
miles from the Gates foundation, with laboratories equipped with =
gene-sequencing machines, microchip arrays, and powerful new computers. =
It's a Bill Gates kind of place. Institute scientists are working on =
several malaria vaccines. One of them is based on research by Michal =
Fried and Patrick Duffy, who is on loan from the Army. Their discovery =
of a distinct form of falciparum which adheres only to the placenta =
suggests that they might be able to create a vaccine for pregnant women. =
Their goal is to prevent sickness, not necessarily to prevent infection.
</p>
<p>
Stefan Kappe, a young German parasitologist at the institute, takes an =
entirely different approach. He has been studying the mosquito itself. =
Since the parasite moves from a human into a mosquito, as well as in the =
other direction, Kappe is trying to find a way to prevent infection by =
disabling falciparum before it can make it to the liver. Exposure to =
radiation weakens the sporozoites that mosquitoes carry in their =
salivary glands. When those sporozoites are injected into a person, they =
stimulate immune activity and protect him from malaria. That is how most =
basic vaccines work. A measles vaccine, for example, is a live strain of =
the virus that has been weakened to the point where it can do no harm; =
yet it tricks the immune system into creating antibodies to defend =
itself against genuine measles viruses.
</p>
<p>
Until sequencing technology made it possible to manipulate genes in the =
parasite, this approach never seemed worth pursuing. The parasite has to =
be alive to spark the immune system, and it would have been unethical to =
inoculate people with live parasites--even weak ones. Nor would it ever =
be possible to X-ray enough mosquitoes to protect the world from them. =
So Kappe is using genomics to destroy only those genes which are =
essential for the parasite to grow in the liver. He, too, is supported =
by a grant from the Gates foundation. "I would never have received =
funding for this particular project--any classical review mechanism at =
N.I.H. would have come back and said no, too far-out," he said. "The =
Gates people know it's far-out. But sometimes far-out works.''
</p>
<p>
Kappe wondered what would happen if he could weaken the falciparum =
parasite enough to stimulate the human immune system without endangering =
it. It's a tricky prospect, because the parasite needs to do at least =
part of its job. Weaken the parasite too much and it would not be =
capable of inducing a useful immune response; but, if it isn't weakened =
enough, the inoculation would simply give people malaria. Relying on the =
full spectrum of modern genetic tools (as well as on educated guesses), =
Kappe was able to identify several genes that help falciparum to grow =
and to survive. He then started deleting individual genes, to see what =
effect that caused. "We were lucky to find two genes that when we delete =
them the parasite really gets stuck in its development,'' Kappe told me. =
"What matters the most here is that these deletions don't affect other =
parts of the life cycle." Without these genes, the falciparum parasite =
cannot cause infections in red blood cells, because it never makes it =
out of the liver.

The only place you can keep enough mosquitoes to do this kind of =
research is an insectary--which is a cross between a zoo for insects and =
a laboratory. There are just a few in the world; they require constant =
oversight, lots of space, and a perfect climate. The insectary at the =
institute is a very humid room, and, as we entered, several of Kappe's =
colleagues, working with dissecting microscopes, were removing parasites =
from the glands of mosquitoes. Behind the researchers lay long pans with =
hundreds of tiny eggs about to hatch. A female anopheles will lay a raft =
of about a hundred eggs at a time. The males live for sex, last about a =
week, and then die. Kappe's vaccine has worked in mice, stranding the =
parasite in the liver and preventing further infection. But he has a =
long way to go before he can test it on humans. "This association =
between the parasite and the mosquito is millions of years old," he =
said. "It's absolutely a brilliant example of evolution. But if we want =
to succeed we will have to reproduce this intricate relationship =
exactly. We have to create that environment and then manipulate it. I =
come from genetics and from the world of parasite biology. I believe =
that with modern technology we can make live vaccines that are =
protective. I don't think that is in the future. I think it's now.''

David Schellenberg, a clinical epidemiologist from the London School of =
Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, has spent much of the past decade in =
Africa, and he sees the struggle in a less exalted way. On the day of my =
visit, he was standing in the middle of his office at the Ifakara Health =
Research and Development Centre, on the northern edge of Dar es Salaam, =
along with a young Tanzanian man who works for him. Schellenberg was =
excited. A rough wooden box sat on a table in front of them. Jumper =
cables snaked out of one end of the box, and a car's cigarette lighter =
was at the other end. Schellenberg thanked the man profusely. "This =
could be as important and valuable as anything we have ever done for =
malaria,'' he told me as I entered the room. He was not entirely joking. =
Schellenberg is running some of the most important malaria drug trials =
in Africa--testing whether a few doses of preventive medicine will help =
protect infants from the disease. The contraption on the table had been =
rigged to charge the batteries of computers in the many study villages =
where electricity is often absent. "We need computers to work out there =
if we are to collect data and store them properly. But, with the =
electricity so bad, the computers are completely unreliable." =
Schellenberg is a soft-spoken, studious-looking man with close-cropped =
hair, blue eyes, and gold wire-rimmed glasses. Like any doctor who has =
worked both in the lab and in the village, he is well aware of the =
difference between efficacy and effectiveness. When researchers announce =
that they know how to do something because they have the scientific data =
to back it up, those data are based on efficacy--not effectiveness. "The =
difference between what you see in the clinical world and what you find =
in the real world can be enormous," Schellenberg said. "And in the real =
world sometimes you don't feel you can afford the fine print." Some of =
the earliest trials involving preventive treatment of pregnant women and =
of children were conducted at Ifakara. "Often a clinical trial proves =
something can work--the use of bed nets, for example, or a new regimen =
of drugs," Schellenberg said. "But does that mean that everyone in every =
village or city in Africa will accept the results?"
</p>
<p>
Schellenberg and his wife, Joanna, who is also a malaria researcher, =
have two sons, eleven and seven. They moved back to Africa from England =
last year. Their first posting lasted six years, but their older son =
contracted drug-resistant malaria and almost died. "He was airlifted to =
Nairobi, and he had chest surgery,'' Schellenberg told me. "Then he had =
pneumonia and that led to abscesses. We very nearly lost him. He is fine =
now, but it was scary. You can imagine after that there was a lot of =
soul-searching about whether or not to return. But we are here because =
this is where we really belong.'' He said this with no remorse. "Look, =
we are lucky. We were able to call a plane and get him out of there. So =
he lived. That is not the way it is for the other children who get this =
disease. There are no planes. No drugs. No doctors. And no real hope of =
surviving. So when we asked ourselves, 'What are we doing by coming =
back,' we had to think about that."
</p>
<p>
The Gates foundation supports much of Schellenberg's work--and other =
studies of intermittent therapy as well. He is grateful. But =
Schellenberg, like many of his colleagues, is concerned about what he =
sees as a growing preoccupation with futuristic technology. "Ten years =
ago, we were saying that a vaccine would not be available for at least =
ten years. Now we seem to be saying the same thing. I think we need not =
put our hopes in magic bullets when we have the arsenal to make such an =
impact now. What we need are magic guns, not magic bullets,'' he said. =
"We need to be able to deliver what we already have.'' Schellenberg =
admits that while he is attracted to the "shiny, scientifically exciting =
stuff, a lot of what we are doing in southern Tanzania now is not =
scientifically challenging. It's like that wooden box with the cigarette =
lighter. We are making simple things. And the questions we are asking =
are not very exciting in scientific ways. But they are urgent. This is =
what we need to do now. We need to make things work. Not just work under =
ideal conditions."

Bill Gates approaches life as if it were a problem that needed to be =
solved. At times, he appears as if he had stepped out of a Henry James =
novel: a confounding mixture of innocence, arrogance, and belief in what =
is right--the American Man. Gates's eager, energetic view of the world =
is stamped on everything he does: from his house, where guests can =
program their rooms to reflect their taste, to the software company he =
founded. Microsoft, whatever else it is or has become, began as a =
collection of smart people who realized that technology, when driven by =
the right kind of intelligence, rules the world. Gates feels the same =
way about improving public health. His faith in progress is absolute. =
"The complexity of biology and how it works is so interesting,'' he told =
me one day. "And, in terms of human welfare, the idea of getting rid of =
these diseases--which could be in our lifetime--is just very exciting.'' =
That final sentiment makes many public-health officials nervous. "The =
eradication of disease and the alleviation of suffering depends more on =
developing the skills of talented people than on technology,'' a =
generally favorable editorial about the foundation recently declared in =
the British scientific journal The Lancet. Gates has put aside more than =
a billion dollars to help disadvantaged American students earn college =
degrees. The Lancet editorial suggests that a similar educational =
investment in developing countries might do more good than many programs =
that emphasize science alone. Both historical and contemporary studies =
have shown that the public health of a nation only improves through a =
combination of social and political measures. Medicine matters, of =
course, but it is far from the only thing that does. (The United States =
is the richest country in the world and the most technologically =
advanced, yet it ranks twenty-ninth among world nations in life =
expectancy and thirty-eighth in infant mortality.) "In calling on the =
world's researchers to develop innovative solutions targeted to 'the =
most critical scientific challenges in global health,' the Gates =
Foundation has turned to a narrowly conceived understanding of health as =
a product of technical interventions divorced from economic, social, and =
political contexts,'' the Canadian health economist Anne-Emanuelle Birn =
wrote recently.
</p>
<p>
Gates has heard these criticisms, and the foundations's recent =
commitment to a full-scale attack on malaria in Zambia illustrates that. =
It is impossible to doubt the sincerity of Bill or Melinda Gates, or to =
question the impact they have had, and will have, on the world. Yet it =
would be hard to expect the iconic American technologist, a man who has =
made one of the world's great fortunes by harnessing the flow of =
information, to abdicate the future. "I do believe in progress,'' he =
told me in Seattle. "Capitalism is an unusual system, in that somebody =
can have so much wealth. But then again it's an unusual system because =
money can actually flow from the luckiest to the unluckiest and =
hopefully in clever ways so that it's not just writing checks.
</p>
<p>
"We do not measure ourselves at all by the amount given,'' he continued. =
"We have taken on the top twenty killers, and for everything we do we =
look at the cost per life saved and real outcomes in terms of how things =
get improved. It's fun, and it is also an enormous responsibility. But =
having my job at Microsoft is also fun and a huge responsibility. That =
is true for being a parent. Many of the most important things in life =
are like that. Why else would you want to get up in the morning?"</p>
