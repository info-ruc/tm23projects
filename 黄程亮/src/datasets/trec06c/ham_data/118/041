Adobe Macromedia Flash Products Contain Vulnerabilities

   Original release date: March 16, 2006
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT


Systems Affected

   Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, or other operating
   systems with any of the following Adobe Macromedia products installed:
     * Flash Player 8.0.22.0 and earlier
     * Flash Professional 8
     * Flash Basic
     * Flash MX 2004
     * Flash Debug Player 7.0.14.0 and earlier
     * Flex 1.5
     * Breeze Meeting Add-In 5.1 and earlier

   For more complete information, refer to Adobe Security Bulletin
   APSB06-03.


Overview

   There are critical vulnerabilities in Macromedia Flash player and
   related software. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a
   remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a
   denial of service on a vulnerable system.


I. Description

   Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03 addresses vulnerabilities in
   Macromedia Flash Player and related software. Further information is
   available in the following US-CERT Vulnerability Note:

   VU#945060 - Adobe Macromedia Flash products contain multiple
   vulnerabilities 

   Several vulnerabilities in Adobe Macromedia Flash products may allow a
   remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   (CVE-2006-0024)

   Several operating systems, including Microsoft Windows (see Microsoft
   Security Advisory 916208), have vulnerable versions of Flash installed
   by default. Systems with Flash-enabled web browsers are vulnerable. An
   attacker could host a specially crafted Flash file on a web site and
   convince a user to visit the site.


II. Impact

   A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with
   the privileges of the user. If the user is logged on with
   administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of
   an affected system. An attacker may also be able to cause a denial of
   service.


III. Solution

Apply Updates

   Adobe has provided the updates for these vulnerabilities in APBS06-03.

Disable Flash

   Please see Microsoft Security Advisory 916208 for instructions on how
   to disable Flash on Microsoft Windows. For other operating systems and
   web browsers, please contact the appropriate vendor.
