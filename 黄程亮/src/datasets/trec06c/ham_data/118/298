Carroll College in Helena, Montana, is seeking to fill a tenure-track,
faculty position in civil engineering with emphasis on water resources
and environmental engineering. Our CE program is new, receiving ABET
accreditation for the first time in 2001. Since then, ABET has awarded
us its Innovation Award for our engineering and mathematics programs,
and we have built a new CE Lab building with a fully equipped high-bay
lab, a modern classroom, and offices. We have approximately 50
undergraduate students in civil engineering and another 25 students in
our 3-2 engineering program. Carroll has a total enrollment of 1500
students.

With the hope of drawing a larger pool of applicants, we are reopening
our search and we have changed some of the requirements for the
position, particularly as they pertain to Professional Licensure. For
priority consideration, application materials should be received by
March 31, 2006. Please distribute the attached announcement to
individuals who might be interested in a faculty position in Montana
with our new, highly successful civil engineering program.

Thank you,

Interim VP for Academic Affairs and Dean of the College
(Normally) Chair, Department of Mathematics, Engineering, and Computer
