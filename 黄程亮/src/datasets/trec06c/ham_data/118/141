Dear all,

I am using DMDX to run experiments with children and the forum and the 
online tips have been of a great help to build the scripts. 
I am builiding tests with an animated character presenting non word 
repetition and rapid automatic naming tasks and I would like to record the 
oral response in a wav file (but not the RT so I used RecordVocal on its 
own) and the following mouse response in the azk file. 
I managed to do all that with DMDX (thank you) but I cannot record responses 
longer than 30-40 s into .wav file (at <t 49000> DMDX writes "malloc of 
record buffer failed ..."). I guess this means that I am asking too much but 
in case I wanted to ask if there is a special parameter to specify in order 
to record 1 or even 2 minutes long files or is 40-ish the max? The best 
would be a kind of <notimelimit> parameter for recording - but I think it is 
impossible.

Please find a piece of my script below that works fine :)

Would be gratefull for any tips
