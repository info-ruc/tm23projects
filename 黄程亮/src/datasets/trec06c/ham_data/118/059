Hi class,

I have finally put all of the readings online for the rest of the 
semester.  So now we need to work to get presenters matched up
with the readings.

Most urgently, we need someone to present this Thursday, March 23.

To sweeten the deal for this somewhat-short-notice situation, I'll
guarantee that the two people who present this Thursday do not
have to present again for the rest of the semester.

This offer should be most attractive to those of you who have
not yet presented at all:
   Hari Angepat
   Katie Coons
   Tom Hartin
   Paul Navratil
   Hany Ramadan
   Prakash Ramrakhyani
   Kevin Resnick

The two topics are:

1) Overview of communication programming models and their challenges

2) Active messages: A Mechanism for Integrated Communication and
    Computation

More details are available on the class web site.

I am also accepting volunteers for presentations for the remainder of
the semester.  Please remember that everyone (even CR/NC students)
must present at least once during the semester.  Several of you
will have to present twice.  If I don't get enough volunteers, I
will randomly pick, after excluding the CR/NC students and a few
students who did particularly hard presentations on their first
round.

Note: the M-Machine paper (#2 on March 30th) is already spoken for.

Bill
