Sendmail Race Condition Vulnerability

   Original release date: March 22, 2006
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT


Systems Affected

   Sendmail versions prior to 8.13.6.


Overview

   A race condition in Sendmail may allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code.


I. Description

   Sendmail contains a race condition caused by the improper handling of
   asynchronous signals. In particular, by forcing the SMTP server to
   have an I/O timeout at exactly the correct instant, an attacker may be
   able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Sendmail
   process.

   Details, including statements from affected vendors are available in
   the following Vulnerability Note:
   VU#834865 - Sendmail contains a race condition
   A race condition in Sendmail may allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code.
   (CVE-2006-0058)

   Please refer to the Sendmail MTA Security Vulnerability Advisory and
   the Sendmail version 8.13.6 release page for more information.


II. Impact

   A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code with
   the privileges of the Sendmail process. If Sendmail is running as
   root, the attacker could take complete control of an affected system.


III. Solution

Upgrade Sendmail

   Sendmail version 8.13.6 has been released to correct this issue. In
   addition to VU#834865, Sendmail 8.13.6 addresses other security issues
   and potential weaknesses in the Sendmail code.

   Patches to correct this issue in Sendmail versions 8.12.11 and 8.13.5
   are also available.
