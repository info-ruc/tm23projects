two, the CEEOL content will be indexed by Google Scholar.  --Peter Suber.]



We are very pleased to inform you about the=20
latest development of the Central and Eastern=20
European Online Library (C.E.E.O.L.). The library=20
provides access to scholarly and cultural=20
periodicals from Central and Eastern Europe via a=20
consolidated portal on the Internet (see:=20
<http://www.ceeol.com/>www.ceeol.com )

The covered subjects of the library include=20
humanities and social sciences, with a strong=20
focus on social and political studies, as well as=20
history =96 a subject that has especially developed during the last year.

In the last four months 17 new titles have been=20
added. The new titles bring up to 220 the number=20
of Central and Eastern European periodicals=20
offered by our online library in full text PDF=20
format. Since one year every week at least one=20
new editor or periodical joined the network and=20
we are confident of the future sustainability of this development.

It had been one of our main targets during 2005=20
to balance the originally strong focus of=20
C.E.E.O.L. on South-Eastern Europe. Today more=20
than 25 periodicals from Poland, 14 from the=20
Czech Republic as well as numerous Baltic=20
journals are accessible via C.E.E.O.L.

As far as we can overview the Internet in matters=20
of scholarly resources from Central Europe,=20
C.E.E.O.L. has become the most comprehensive=20
source of information and content. Actually 11=20
American/Canadian and 10 European universities have subscribed to our=
 library.

Last week the European Commission launched its=20
project of a =93European Digital Library=94, designed=20
as the "European flagship initiative" to answer=20
the digitization project of Google (i.e.=20
=93America=94). C.E.E.O.L. on its part started a=20
cooperation with Google scholar to get all the=20
documents of our library full-text indexed and=20
searchable via Google Scholar in very near future.

For us a digital library should be considered as=20
=93European=94 or =93American=94 just based on its=20
content and not regarding the origin of the=20
initiators. Thus C.E.E.O.L. in fact is a Central=20
European library, yet it is done for readers all over the world.

We hope C.E.E.O.L. will prove to be a valuable=20
research resource for you and your colleagues.


With kind regards,

Wolfgang Klotz
