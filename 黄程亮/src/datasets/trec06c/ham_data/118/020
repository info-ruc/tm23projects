VLBI project BB217B was observed with the GBT
at 4983 MHz in an array with the VLBA, VLA and Effelsberg.

Everything seemed to be working just marvelously.
All scans were recorded.
The weather was clear and cold.

Pulse cals were at about 2.5%;
Tsys about 25K.

Tape DSCP0079 is being shipped to Socorro today.

Prior to the run we swapped BBC#7, which had an
LO lock error at 604.51 MHz.  It was swapped with
one from the 20-meter rack.
