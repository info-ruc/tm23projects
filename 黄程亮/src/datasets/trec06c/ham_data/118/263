Hi fine-grain seminar,

This is just a quick reminder of what I said in class today about paper 
presentations.

1) The following students have not presented at all yet, and have not
    yet told me what paper they'd like to present:

Katie Coons
Tom Hartin

2) Most of you will be "eligible" for a lottery drawing to determine who
    has to present a second time.  But by then the pickings for papers
    might not be what you want.  If you'd like to pre-empt this
    possibility, you can volunteer for a second presentation now,
    in which case I'll try to give you your preferred paper and you'll
    help to save your fellow students from the lottery.

I will hold the lottery just prior to next week's class, so if you
want to volunteer please put in your requests soon.

Note, the following students are exempt from the lottery
for various reasons such as taking the class CR/NC or accepting
my incentive to present just after spring break:
   Hari Angepat
   Peter Djeu
   Paul Navratil
   Hany Ramadan

Bill
