Dear Colleagues,



Action short of a strike begins to bite across the sectors -- thousands
already reported to be affected:

Evidence is growing that the action short of a strike is beginning to bite
hard. According to an online survey, each member taking the action is
currently affecting an average of more than 100 students and this is well
before the exam period starts in earnest. Reports continue to flood in via
the online Action Form, revealing that AUT members are taking action across
the whole sector and this action is having a real, tangible effect on the
Universities' ability to function.



Wherever members have reported back in large numbers, we can see that the
impact is absolutely huge. Every indication is that right across the sector
our members are determined to show Vice Chancellors that they will no
longer be neglected. The message is, KEEP THE REPORTS COMING IN! Every
report we get shows us how effective the action is, prevents the employers
from spreading misinformation and boosts the confidence of all our members.
Go here now to submit your form:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1548



Employers claim 'serious' offer will be delivered on March 28:

Many of you will have seen the report in the THES (March 10) which stated
that 'University employers are set to place a "serious" pay offer on the
negotiating table later this month in a bid to end industrial action by
academics..'. If the employers body already know what they are going to
offer, why don't they meet us today? We have been requesting unconditional
talks since October. To make it clear, the AUT will be the judge of whether
the offer is "serious", and we do not see why members and students have to
wait another two weeks to find out.  We will not call off or suspend our
action until we have an offer which meets our aspirations for you.



Bully boy tactics won't work, Sally Hunt tells employers:

Local news on local action keeps coming into the press office by email, fax
and through the post. Please do keep it coming in to Dan in the press
office. If your local paper's not covering what's going on then do give Dan
a shout in the office for local contact details or any advice -
dan.ashley@aut.org.uk In the news this week Sally Hunt tells the THES that
universities who might be considering docking staff pay should think again
and AUT staff at Sussex step up their protests against the closure of the
chemistry department. Read all about that and more:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1571



NUS launches 'End it Today' campaign:

NUS have launched a campaign aimed at mounting significant pressure on
individual employers. They are encouraging students at all affiliated
institutions to submit un-marked essays to their Vice-Chancellors and to
lodge formal complaints via their intuitions complaints procedure. The
threat of individual students or their parents suing universities looks set
to become a reality with AUT and NUS receiving a number of queries as to
how to proceed with this course of action. All such queries should be
directed immediately to the National Union of Students. It really is
crucial that we maintain and build dialogue with students. Clearly whilst
we continue to do this via the national structures, nothing is more
effective than a member talking directly with their students. We have
developed a model letter for individuals to pass on to students regarding
the campaign. Please adapt as you wish:

Laurie Taylor in the THES puts the case for VCs...

Writing to staff on behalf of the Vice Chancellor of the mythical Poppleton
University Laurie Taylor states '...Is it merely a coincidence that my own
refusal to participate in militant action has allowed my own salary to rise
by over 25 per cent in the past three years even though there's not a jot
of evidence to suggest that I've done anything to deserve it? I think
not...' To read the column in full go to:

Website visits rocket as action kicks in:

Last week we had a huge surge in visits to the web site with 4-5 times the
number of usual visitors and about 4 times the usual downloads of the AUT
application form. The major areas of interest were the guidelines for ASOS:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1523 , the FAQ's on ASOS:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1556

the online ASOS reporting form:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1548 and finally, the report on
the VC's pay rise continues to be a firm favourite!



Sussex slammed for plan to cull Chemistry:

Sussex university announced this week that it would be closing its
Chemistry department as part of a plan that will also see 45 jobs go in
Continuing Education and other departments, apparently to address its
financial problems and make way for 'research stars'. This news was greeted
with outrage among the staff and students at Sussex and has been widely
condemned. Nobel Laureate and Chemist Sir Harry Kroto is considering
returning his honorary degree from the university, while the Royal Society
of Chemists dismissed the plan as motivated by 'short-term financial
considerations', for which they saw no justification. And all this during
National Science week, and as the CBI warned that the decline in science
graduates was like 'a car-crash in slow motion'.



In response to the news, MPs on the prestigious Science and Technology
Select Committee announced an emergency session on 27th March at which the
Head of Chemistry at Sussex will appear alongside VC Alaisdair Smith and
the acting Chief Executive of HEFCE. Sussex AUT are fighting the proposed
cuts, protesting outside Senate today and if the proposal is endorsed by
this body, carrying the fight to the University Council next week. Please
send your messages of support to Jim Guild at J.Guild@sussex.ac.uk



And finally....this from the University of Nottingham LA:

....spotted on UoN's web page about bursaries, that they define "lower
income" as meaning below £41,500!  The exact quote is: "The University of
Nottingham is offering a very generous package of bursaries to lower-income
students - this generally means students with household income below
£41,500."  So, that means that this University considers that probably a
substantial majority of our members are on "lower incomes"!
