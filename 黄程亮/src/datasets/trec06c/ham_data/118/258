Dear colleague,



*        Employers cancel talks with AUT and NATFHE because we are
"taking action" *        "Serious" offer will not now be made say UCEA *        What mandate did UCEA actually have to scupper talks? *        UCEA seek suspension of AUT action for "at least a month" *        Employers agree to talk with Unison and support staff unions
even though they are in dispute with UCEA subscribers on pensions
*        Students and Minister call for negotiations to break deadlock
*        Employers surrender the "moral high ground" says THES *        Action reports continue to flood in *        Were talks cancelled in your name? Ask your VC today



Employers cancel talks

Well, we were all set to finally begin negotiations with the employers
next Tuesday.  They had been telling us since the beginning of March
that they had a "serious" offer to make.  We said we were looking
forward to meeting.  Sally even had a letter published in this morning's
Guardian saying "we must hope that they are serious about making us a
serious pay offer on Tuesday." Read the full text of Sally's letter at
http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/comment/story/0,,1737393,00.html



What mandate do UCEA have?

Yet yesterday, they changed their mind and wrote to us saying that there
could be no meeting until we agreed to suspend the action.  This
followed a UCEA Board meeting, but it was clear that this latest tactic
had not been agreed by all institutions, with many local associations
informing us that the first their VCs and Personnel Directors knew of
UCEA's refusal to meet was when they read the AUT press release.



You can read Sally's response to the employers' letter here
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1583, and read what The
Guardian made of it here
http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1737057,00.html



Suspend action for a month, UCEA tells unions

The full extent of what the employers wanted the unions to do was
revealed in the THES this morning which reported as follows: "Ms
Prudence [UCEA Chief Executive] said that any action should be suspended
for the duration of the pay talks.  With the second meeting scheduled
for April 25 and perhaps another after that, this would mean halting
industrial action for at least a month."



No meeting if in dispute rule only applies to AUT and NATFHE

This could never be acceptable to AUT or NATFHE since it would remove
any pressure on the employers to settle at an acceptable level.  Indeed,
UCEA have agreed to meet with the support staff unions but not us on 28
March even though they are also in dispute over staff pensions.  AUT
members have received tremendous backing from Unison colleagues locally
in this dispute and for our part we will give full support within the
law to our colleagues in Unison and other unions who are on strike to
defend their pensions on the 28th.  Attempts to divide and rule staff
will fail.



NUS provides strongest backing ever, help them to help us!

Kat Fletcher, NUS President, has repeated her call for the employers to
negotiate unconditionally with the unions.  Kat also said: "When top-up
fees were being debated, vice-chancellors, employers and the government
tried to make the teaching unions turn their back on the NUS and support
the call for higher fees, arguing that they would benefit from students'
cash. But the lecturers unions refused to capitulate. They stood side by
side with us, not because it was the easy thing to do, but because it
was the right thing to do. I'm proud to be a student unionist, I'm
incredibly passionate about what I do, and that means I believe in
collectivism, in democracy and in solidarity. That's why I won't let
them divide us this time."



Kat deserves our thanks for this strong support, but please do more than
that.  Talk to your students.  Explain our case, and explain that we
want to get back to working normally - it is the employers who are
dragging the dispute out and threatening students' futures.  You can
read Kat's full article at
http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/columnist/story/0,,1736034,00.htm

Minister calls for talks

Meanwhile, in an answer to a parliamentary question tabled on 6 March
2006, Bill Rammell said that "the Government would encourage both
employers and unions to reach a speedy resolution on this matter, to
ensure minimal further disruption to students."  For our part we are
ready and willing to negotiate today, as we have been since last
October.



UCEA surrender "high ground" says THES

In their editorial piece today, the THES states that: "the new [UCEA]
conditions will make an already intractable dispute even harder to
resolve".  In noting that UCEA have accused the unions of rushing to
confrontation, the piece continues "Now they are sacrificing the high
ground by doing the same themselves."



Keep your action reports coming in

We are continuing to receive hundreds of reports of individual actions
taken as part of this dispute. Read some of them here
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1576



If you have not submitted what you are doing yet, please do so at
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1548.



What is your university's position? Find out today

UCEA's new hard-line tactics were not cleared with all their
institutions, but followed a small meeting of board members.  As we have
said, the first many universities knew that talks had been cancelled was
when AUT told them.  Write to your VC or HR Director asking them if the
university agrees with the UCEA policy of refusing talks and prolonging
the dispute.



Thank you for taking the time to read this.



All/best
