   Hmm, so show us the diagnostics of the failure.  Then we'll get to see 
what DMDX's interpretation of what the input device name you put in the 
item file is and what the available devices are.  I don't suppose you 
haven't put quotes around the name?  Names with spaces in them almost 
always need quotes around them.
