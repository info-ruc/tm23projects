There shouldn't be any particular limit.  You could try putting more memory 
in your machine (RAM, not hard disk) I guess but 49 seconds is only a two 
megabyte buffer and that's shouldn't be anything amazing.  It's possible 
that your sound drivers are freaking at being told to create a two megabyte 
buffer I guess.
