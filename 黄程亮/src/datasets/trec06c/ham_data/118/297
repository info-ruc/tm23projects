Dear All,



Media digest:

*	UCEA preach dialogue not dispute and then bar us from pay talks.

*	NUS condemns the employers action and calls on students to back
the lecturers and get the employers talking. *	Sally Hunt sets out her agenda for further education.

All this and more in this week's media digest at

What is your university's position?

Thanks to all of you who have emailed back your VC's position on UCEA's
latest hard-line tactic. If you have not already done so please write to
your VC or HR Director asking them if the university agrees with the
UCEA policy of refusing talks and prolonging the dispute and let us know
the response.
