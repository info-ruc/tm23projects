Hi CS352-ers,

Since the response for the tutorial session is poor, there wont be any 
regular tutorial sessions from now. Instead, I will hold office
hours in the same place at the same time (ART 1.110 Tue 4:00-5:00PM).
But, I will be happy to hold sessions on request. Please mail me if you have any concerns on this issue.


Thanks.

Madhavi
