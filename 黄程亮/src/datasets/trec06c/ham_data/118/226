New Conference Dates:

As you may be aware, Yale University (USA) is organising the first
international conference on Access to Knowledge, the A2K Conference,
from April 21-23 (http://islandia.law.yale.edu/isp/a2kconfmain.html).
This conference shares many commonalities with the Asia Commons
Conference in terms of themes, topics addressed and desired outcomes. In
view of this, the organisers of the Asia Commons Conference believe that
a deferment of Asia Commons, which was previously scheduled from April
18-20, to June 6-8 will give an opportunity to bring the ideas and
lessons from the A2K Conference to the Asia Commons Conference, as well
as to ensure that a number of participants and speakers can attend both
conferences.

Please note that dates related to participant registration and
conference papers have also changed as follows:

Participant registration deadline: March 31, 2006
Notification of conference scholarship grant: April 14, 2006

Paper proposal deadline: March 21, 2006
Proposal acceptance: March 31, 2006
Full paper submission: May 15, 2006

We look forward to your continued interest in this event and would like
to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Please do not
hesitate to contact conference organisers if you require clarifications
or have any concerns regarding the new conference dates:

Conference Information:

During the last 20 years or so, the level, scope, territorial extent,
and role of copyrights and patents have expanded into new sectors. There
has been much discussion and debate on the impact of copyrights and
patents at a micro level of economic activity while at a macro level,
policy dialogue in several international fora, not least of which is
WIPO, has been addressing barriers posed by copyrights and patents.

Asia Commons: Asian Conference on the Digital Commons invites:

     * researchers working in the area of copyrights and patents,
     * promoters of collaborative models,
     * development practitioners engaged in collaborative content
creation and dissemination, and
     * custodians of public information

to go beyond the current dialogue and debate to explore key issues and
ideas related to access to knowledge and culture in Asia.

Participants are invited to explore key themes and questions related to
the Asian Commons:

     * What is the relationship between infrastructure and copyrights on
access to culture and knowledge?
     * How do software and business process patents affect innovation?
     * What are the impacts of patents on software innovations in Asia?
     * What are the emerging Open Business Models for content production
in Asia?
     * Given existing legal, cultural and infrastructural environments
both within and outside of Asia, how can we contribute to increasing
access to knowledge and culture through an Asia Commons?

While we will be inviting a number of speakers who are seen as
thought-leaders in the field of Access to Knowledge and Culture, we will
also look to innovative approaches to ensure a high degree of
interaction among participants in spaces and sessions which are designed
to maximize the exchange of experiences and ideas.

Conference Fees, Registration, and Scholarships:

through funding made available by the International Development Research
