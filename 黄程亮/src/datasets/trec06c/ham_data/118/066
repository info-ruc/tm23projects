Critical Assessment of MicroArray Data Analysis (CAMDA06)
June 8-9, 2006
Hock Plaza
Durham, North Carolina, U.S.A.
Hosted by: Duke Bioinformatics Group, Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center


Registration is now open for the 2006 CAMDA Conference!!!


We invite you to join us for the 6th annual CAMDA Conference to be held
June 8th and 9th, 2006 in Durham, NC.  This is an exciting year for CAMDA
as we add new aspects we have not tried in the past.  In addition, a
pre-conference seminar with guest speaker Dr. Richard Simon on June 7, 2006
will be offered to those who would like an in-depth review of microarrays
before the conference.

There is a single common challenge dataset from the CDC Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome Research Group that contains gene expression, proteomic, SNP, and
clinical data.  We hope this will foster integrative and biological
goal-oriented analysis.  Furthermore, the CDC has agreed to experimentally
validate biomarkers identified in submitted abstracts!  We have allowed
enough time so that the CDC will be able to perform the experiments and
present the results at the conference.  This exciting opportunity will
bring everyone's research efforts full circle by giving us a qualitative
measure of the analyses employed.
