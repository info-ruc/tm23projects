Hi seminar,

By popular request, I've put up a web page with some possible ideas for 
final projects, as well as a general discussion of some of the kinds of
final projects.  This is not meant to be an exclusive list, just a 
starting point to get you thinking.

Here it is:
http://www-csl.csres.utexas.edu/~billmark/teach/cs395t-06-spring/project/index.html

Beware that any project requiring modifications to a CMP simulator is 
likely to be quite a bit of work, unless you are already familiar with
one.  I do understand this; and it is quite possible to do a good project
without making changes to an architecture simulator.

Bill
