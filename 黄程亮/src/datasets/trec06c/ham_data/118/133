COMPUTER SCIENCE SEMINAR SERIES
Getting to Know Ruby

Wednesday, March 22nd, 3:00pm
Weir Hall, Room 235

Presenter: Ben Pharr
Computer Scientist, Global Technical Systems

Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is a relatively new programming
language whose syntax borrows from Perl and Python. It is completely
object-oriented, dynamically typed, and garbage collected. Above all,
it is fun to program in.

This seminar will give a thorough introduction to Ruby and briefly
touch on some of its more advanced features. Ruby on Rails, a web
development platform built in and for Ruby, will also be briefly
discussed.
