DEAR BELOVED.


As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Hussain El Amin a merchant in Tunisa and Dubai.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my businesses.


Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.


But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life in a different way from how I have lived it.


Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria, Malaysia and some countries in Africa. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.


I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of  Eleven  Million United States Dollars $11,000,000,00 that I have with a Security Company abroad.


I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10% for you, your time and also any expenses incured during this assignment. God be with you.


Kindly reply me on my confidential email account : helamin0@excite.com

God bless you greatly as you do. 

Regards, 


Hussain El Amin.
