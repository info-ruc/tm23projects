  Ah, yeah, this is a screw up that I've noticed once or twice and that I
think other people have come across before.  When I experienced the problem
IIRC it came from not having run TimeDX on the machine.  When TimeDX is run
and any parameters are set it creates the root of the tree in the registry
that both TimeDX and DMDX store values in, if DMDX is run before TimeDX
(something that shouldn't happen) then the DMDX browse button fails because
it can't find any trace of the registry entries it needs, I think ---
having just looked at the registry I find that the previous item file names
are stored by themselves, so much for theory...  Perhaps your registry has
been corrupted by something.  If you can't fix it by running TimeDX and
setting a few parameters then you'll have to run regedit and find the key
named DMDX and delete it and if that doesn't get it find the key named
TimeDX and delete it as well, you'll have to time all used video modes and
so forth after deleting the latter registry key.  Both keys should be in My
Computer / HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / SOFTWARE.
