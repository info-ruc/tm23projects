  It is presicely your usage of RequestScheduled that is causing the
errors.  This keyword is desigined to make the ISI constant and is needed
for such things as ERP recordings and so forth with continuous running.  If
you do infact need a constant ISI you will have to make the Delay keyword
parameter a bit bigger than the largest xx in the error messages you see,
RequestScheduled is in fact nearly obsolete as use of the Delay keyword
sets it anyway.  It only happens when you include RecordVocal because
during the ISI DMDX must write out the recorded vocalization and this takes
extra time.  By default (no RequestScheduled) DMDX will take as long as it
needs and then add 48 ticks to that for an ISI, if you set RequestScheduled
then everything DMDX does in between items must occur in under 48 ticks, if
48 ticks is not enough time you are responsible for determining the correct
amount of time that DMDX will need to complete it's houskeeping and using
that in a Delay parameter (thus making RequestScheduled redundant).
