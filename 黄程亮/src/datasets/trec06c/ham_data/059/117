I have several sensor questions.=20


I would like to use my miniboard as an engine management system. At the=
 present time, I have a small 2 cycle engine from a weed wacker that I would=
 like to control. I would like to have the miniboard gather some information=
 about the atmospheric conditions and use that information to adjust the air=
 fuel mixture.


I figured that I would start with what I thought would be the easiest,=
 sensing the temperature. I have played with a couple of devices (LM34,=
 LM335, and a NTC thermister). The thermister was the first device I found.=
 It works well, but it is not linear. Next I played with the LM335, with and=
 without adjusting it. This also works well, but I can't figure out how to=
 convert the output from the miniboard into a temperature. 1 C =3D 10Mv. I=
 then tried the LM34. There is no calibration pin and it uses farenheit.=
 1F=3D10Mv. For some reason, the output from this device varies very little=
 with changes in the room temperature. Now the present room temperature is=
 58F, during the summer it was 78F. The miniboard returned a value of 158=
 for both of these temperatures. If I use a voltmeter to measure the voltage=
 between ground and the signal pin it reads around 1V. Strange. Ideally, I=
 would like to use the LM34, but the LM335 seems to work much better. That=
 is it is more responsive. Does anyone have any tips on how to use anyone of=
 these devices with the Miniboard or the Handyboard? How to connect them and=
 how to calculate a temperature for the output? I am not wanting to remove=
 the pull-up resistor from the circuit, if that makes a difference. I am=
 also using ICC freeware to program the Miniboard and IC on the HandyBoard.


I would also like the board to sense air pressure and humidity. I have read=
 about capacitors that will vary with humidity, but I have no idea how to=
 make them work with the Miniboard. Can anyone provide any tips on this.


Lastly, I would like the miniboard to track the engine rpms. I have a few=
 ideas on how to do this, but I am not sure about any of them. I figured the=
 easiest way might be to use a reflectance sensor pointed at a nut on the=
 crankshaft. I would paint all but one side of the nut with black paint, and=
 glue a piece of a cd on the one unpainted side. Another idea is to use=
 something on the spark plug wire. I thought a hall effect sensor might=
 work, but I am not sure. Along the same line, I read an note in this months=
 Nuts & Volts about using an inductor on the spark plug wire and a chip to=
 convert the output to a voltage. I am sure I have over simplifed here. I=
 don't remember all of the specifics. Assuming I use one of the first two=
 methods, how long do I need to sample to port to get a reasonable number=
 for the rpms? Does anyone have any suggestions on the method that would be=
 best to use?


Thanks
