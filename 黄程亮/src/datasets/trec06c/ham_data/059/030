I've got four servos attatched to my expansion board and unless I keep the
charger attatched in ZAP mode, I experience a lot of jittering. Has anyone
else experienced this?  Perhaps the NiCads in my Handyboard are old?

Anyhow, I'm going to sever the connection to the handyboard battery and supply
my own power to the servos.  I'd really prefer, however to keep everything
powered by the handyboard; it's much more elegant that way.

In the past, I ran two servos using the Scott Edwards SSC servo controller with
out any glitches.  I got all the power I needed from the handyboard.

Anyhow, thanks for your help/comments.
