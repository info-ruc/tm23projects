Hi,

I'm working on a P166MMX (with a sb awe 32) under win98 and directx7frn (I 
was previously on directx5 and had the same problem).  I have always the 
same error (even when I just resetted the machine):

DirectSoundCreate failed
   DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
   The call failed because the resources (such as priority level) were
   already being used by another caller

I suppressed every apps and it still occurs.

Would someone have an idea?

Thanks.

Boris
