i had a short circuit between the handyboard's TO3 port and the
handyboard's 11V supply. Now, whenever i turn the board on there's only black
boxes on the LCD display. the Power LED is on and the board is in Zap
mode. the message says that the board isn't responding. i've tried
reloading the pcode but it doesn't help. what is wrong??

please help.
