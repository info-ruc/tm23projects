HI =

I am currently working on a project and am using the handyboard for the
purpose of wall following. I want to use the GP2D02 sensor with the same =
but i
find that it (GP2D02) can be used only on digital ports 14 and 15. As i'm=
 not
proficient with assembly language programming, i have not been able to pr=
oceed
further and write a code which can make use of all the digital ports
available. I would greatly appreciate if anyone has accomplished this and=
 can
guide me as to how to go about doing the same. =

Thank you,
Amol
