These are real, genuine degrees that include Bachelors, Masters 
and Doctorate degrees. They are verifiable and student records and
transcripts are also available. This little known s.ecret has been
kept quiet for years. The opp0rtunity exists due to a lega.l loophole
allowing some established colleges to award degrees at their discretion.


With all of the attention that this news has been generating, I wouldn't 
be surprised to see this loophole closed very soon. 

Call n0w for more information today, you'll thank me later...
