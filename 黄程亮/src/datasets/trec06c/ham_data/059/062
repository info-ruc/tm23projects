Subject: Problem with my board

I am using a HD with expansion board.  Periodically when I run the motors at
anything less than 100 they spin with very little power and both the red and
green lights on the board light up.  At full power the motors work perfectly
with only the green light lit.  This problem is very odd because sometimes I
can just let the board sit over night and it works the next day.  Any help or
comments would be appreciated.
