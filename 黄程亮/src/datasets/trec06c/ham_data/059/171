I read on this list over a year ago that you *can* piggyback the two
different chips together and still get the spike protection from the
L293D. It was explained that you don't need to piggyback two L293D
chips, because one spike-protecting chip suffices for the circuit. I
don't recall who said it, but at the time it seemed very authoritative.
