This would work well. I seem to recall doing something similar to this in
the old DMASTR. You need to use a fixed width (i.e. non-proportional) font
like Courier though, otherwise the difference in width of characters like
"w" and "m" vs "i" and "l" would cause problems.

One useful hint is to use Excel formulae (or the text functions in some
other spreadsheet package) to make the item files. For example, you can use
LEN to work out the number of characters in a sentence. Then you can use
FIND(" ", etc) to find the position of space characters that separate each
word, and REPT("#", etc) to replace the letters in each word with # marks.

Good luck,

Matt
