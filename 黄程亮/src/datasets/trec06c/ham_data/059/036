Here is an update:

I added an external power supply for the servos. Same problem.
Everything works fine if I hook up to the charger in ZAP mode.

Anyhow, I added an 0.22 microfarad across +5V and ground simply by sticking it
into the headers on the expansion board and that solved the problem.
Perhaps the expansion board could do with some more filter/decoupling caps?

Anyhow, I guess I'll keep the external power for now.  I just have to find a
place to hold 4 more AA batteries on my robot.  It's tiny.
