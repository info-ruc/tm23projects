  Always the same item or randomly on any item?  I guess it's faintly
possible that the response from the previous item is simply making your
script continue on through the next item, but that is very unlikely, there
is a lot of code to stop this happening (of course, it could always have
another hole in it but I'd be surprised).  It's also possible that there is
one malformed item in there somewhere and because you have scrambling
turned on it moves around the place but it's effect isn't felt until the
item after it, but of course you can't tell because scrambling is on,
remove (or at least temporarily comment out <!s 388>) the scrambling and
grouping commands and see if the error always occurs as the same place.

  As a general rule, unless you want a fixed ISI don't use one, I'd remove
all those Delay specifications, they aren't doing anything except making
DMDX work harder than it needs to.  And even then, people usually use Delay
once in the parameter line and pick a value large enough to be good for all
items under all circumstances.
