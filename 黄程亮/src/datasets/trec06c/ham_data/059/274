  I have released DMDX 1.1.14 which includes:

	A new synonim for <msfd>, <%ms> (which now also checks for zero frame
duration).

	A new keyword <DVOXBeepSpec> for auditory confirmation of of the Digital
VOX trigger.

	Clearing subject id edit box after run.

	Browse button has been tweaked, a possible hole closed but I can't
replicate problems with it so it's difficult to fix.
