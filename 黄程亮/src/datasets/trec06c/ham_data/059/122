I then tried the LM34. There is no calibration
pin and it uses farenheit. 1F=10Mv. For some reason, the output from
this device varies very little with changes in the room temperature. Now

the present room temperature is 58F, during the summer it was 78F. The
miniboard returned a value of 158 for both of these temperatures.


I have used LM34DZ temp sensors a fair number of times and have found
them to be simple to use and reliable. Perhaps the problem is the input
to the
ADC. I suspect impedance mismatch or you need to condition the signal
coming from
the temp. sensor -opamp amplifier circuit between the LM34DZ and the ADC
input?
