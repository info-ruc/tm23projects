Hi Sonny,

I've played with Voice Direct and also with the HM2007 chip.  Both
of them work fine in a quiet environment, but in my limited playing
they were both overwhelmed by the ambient noise of a moving robot.
They both are speaker dependent, and are capable of learning only a
small vocabulary ... but ok for receiving commands once the motor
noise problem is overcome.  Both of my units are on the shelf for
now, but I hope to get back to them soon.

Good luck,
 - Nick -
