Hi handyboard users,
I am using the GP2D02 sensor but i'm facing problems interfacing it with =
the
handyboard. The problem i'm facing is that the test program written by Ba=
rry
has been written only using digital ports 14 and 15. But i want to use mo=
re
than 2 sensors and i am unable to write the coding for the same with all =
the
ports in use. So if anyone has accomplished this, i will be grateful if y=
ou
could help me. I am struck with this and am not able to proceed further o=
n my
project as i'm not proficient in assembly language programming. I would
appreciate your help.
Thank you,
regards
amol
