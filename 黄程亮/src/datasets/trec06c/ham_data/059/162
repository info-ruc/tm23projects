Subject: Using a 293B/293D combination

The HB FAQ mentions using the LM293B and LM293D chips in parallel (e.g.,
one L293D and one L293B) to gain increased current-carrying capability. My
question is, if I do this am I losing the function of the spike-protecting
diodes on the motor outputs that the LM293D provides?

The reason I'm asking is that I have some already-soldered-together pairs
like this that are left over from an old 6.270 board and I'd like to use
them on the HB I'm building.
