Hi,


Thanks for the advices: I installed the newest drivers from Creative, 
change the drivers in timedx and everything seems to work.

Unfortunately I've got a last problem on another machine under win98 and 
directx7frn:
One day it happened that when I pushed the browse button nothing happens: 
the "Select Item File" dialog doesn't appear. I can only run my rtf files 
with the command line.

I reinstalled dmdx: the problem is always there.


Thanks.
