  It's microphones that work well with your sound card, not DMDX.  You'll
have to either (a) figure out what you sound likes in terms of a mic, beit
low or high impedance or (b) buy both and return the one that doesn't work
well.  I tend to use preamplifiers, it's a bitch finding a good mic/sound
card match.
