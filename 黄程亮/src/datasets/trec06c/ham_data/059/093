You can cut the trace going to the pullup resistor corresponding to analog(0)
on the main board and then all of the expansion board analog inputs will be
floating.  Analog(0) is multiplexed to provide all of the analog inputs on the
expansion board. This is what I did and I have five GP2D12 sensors working
fine on my robot.

Look at the PCB diagram in the HB manual and make sure you're cutting the
correct trace.  Even if you do make a mistake, it's easy to fix.
