I had short circuit my TOC3 with a 5V source once. i changed the processor and
the board worked. but i noticed that whenever i downloaded the pcode.s19 file,
it wants to set the OxOD register instead of the OxOc. i downloaded
config0c.s19 from the handyboard website and tried downloading it to handyboard
using the same method as i would the pcode (HBDL.EXE for windows).

the config register was specified to be OxOc but it only wanted to be
downloaded to OxOD. did this a couple of times but it doesn't work.

anybody had the same problem b4, please help.


thanx
