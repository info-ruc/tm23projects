Newark electronics used to sell a humidity sensor based on this
principle for about $ 12.  It should still be available.  I believe it
was made by Phillips.  Basically the variations in capacitor value is
used to vary the frequency of an oscillator & then the frequency is
changed to voltage to get the indication of humidity.  There may be some
linearization issues involved depending on the sensor's characteristics.

I have used one of National's charge pump type freq-to-voltage converter
chip (I think it was LM 2917).  This device is easy to use & quite
linear for most purposes.
