I've mentioned this subject before here, but I never really got an
answer that made much sense...

Has anybody ever tried building a reasonable "LEGO-ish" container for
the Handyboard? Ideally, that would be a sturdy enclosure that still
provides convenient access to all the handyboard's I/O without actually
having to open it up.

I cannot imagine being the only LEGO nut who's been drawn to the idea of
using the handyboard because of its increased versatility over the
Mindstorms unit, but does not like the idea of hooking things up to a
bare motherboard.
