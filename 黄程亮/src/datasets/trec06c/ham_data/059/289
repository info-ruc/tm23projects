Hi,
Since photo reflector with segmented wheel pattern doesn't help in =
precise mobile robot navigation, I intend to use Hewlett Packard optical =
encoder and I have selected HEDS-9140 series.I know someone has tried =
this item long time ago and I hope I can get help from those has =
successfully connected to Handyboard.  I am not so sure if I need the HP =
HCTL-20XX quadrature decoder/counter interface for this purpose? Can I =
use the same encoder icb files that provided in IC ?  How about the =
circuit diagram (if required) for the IC and encoder ?  Answers to all =
these questions will help me a lot! Please help.

Thanks,
William
