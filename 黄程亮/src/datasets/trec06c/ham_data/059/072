Some of the expansion board kits (all? sorry, haven't been paying much
attention to the extension boards yet) mention that they have slots for
LEGO style sensors. Does this mean the sensors they use on their
RCX/Mindstorms stuff? What's the difference, are the LEGO sensors based
around different voltages as opposed to normal Handyboard sensors? We've
been using LEGO motors (but not sensors) in our lab, is there a
difference there as well? Somewhat obviously, I don't know much about
electronics :)
