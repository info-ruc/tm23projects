Here's how to make a cradle for the handyboard which can be attached to 
your bots.  The handyboard simply lifts out of the cradle.

First, set your window to at least this width so diagram lines up--->|

Use four angle beams (the ones with nine holes, with the angle off center 
and x holes at each end), two six unit straight beams, and four of the 
tiny rubber wheels that fit around the small pulleys.  You'll also need 
eight friction fasteners.


Make two of these subassemblies:

    X <---                             X <--rubber pulley wheels
     O                               O      here using 2 unit
       O                           O        axles
         O O O O O X   X O O O O O       <--angle beams
                 ^ ^   ^ ^
                 | |   | |   <--friction fasteners
                -----------
                |O O O O O|  Connect angle beams with straight
                -----------  beams separating angle beam ends
                             by one empty hole in straight beam
                             Use four friction fasteners, in
                             each straight beam, two per angle
                             beam.

Then join the two subassemblies together with axles so that the 
"rubberized" pulley wheels are on the insides. Spaced corrrectly with 
axles, the two subassemblies will form a cradle into which the handyboard 
can be lowered so that it is held gently between the four tiny rubber 
wheels at the four corners and sits on top of the beams beneath.

  --------------   --------------
 |  angle beam |  |  angle beam |
  --------------   --------------
 ---      ---------------       ---
|   | |  |6U 5 hole beam|    | |   | <--pulley w/ rubber wheel
 ---      ---------------       ---
      |                      |
      |                      |
      |                      |
      | <--    axles      -->|        TOP VIEW
      |                      |
      |                      |
 ---  |   ---------------    |  ---
|   | |  |6U 5 hole beam|    | |   | <--pulley w/ rubber wheel
 ---      ---------------       ---
  --------------   --------------
 |  angle beam |  |  angle beam |
  --------------   --------------

Drop the handyboard into this cradle.  Build your bot around the cradle.

Hope this helps :)
