Greetings,
I've heard mention of the various Sharp IR sensors which can give =
different distance readings for different zones. Part of my final year =
project is to design and investigate various sensors, but I really have =
to generate the stuff myself rather than use ready-made components.

Could anyone out there give me an idea or starting point on how these =
devices work? Or how I might go about building something similar, even =
if it isnt to the same scale or accuracy.

any help greatly appreciated

thanks
Adam
