The LEGO sensors and the RCX are the same thing.  The standard Handy
Board (without an expansion board) can handle all of the passive LEGO
sensors such as the touch and rotation sensors.  The expansion board
is needed to use the active sensors such as the light sensor and
others that have been developed by the sensor experts like Michael
Gasperi and others.  The big advantage of the expansion board is the
ability to directly control R/C servos as well as the active LEGO
sensors.

Good luck and have fun,
