Hi there fellow DMDXers!

The time has come for us to set up a number of DMDX machines here at
Macquarie, and I was wondering if anyone could provide us with information
concerning what sort of microphones work well with DMDX in terms of
providing naming latencies/recording vocal responses.  Ideally, we'd be
looking for a microphone that can be attached to a headset.  Any suggestions
would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Anna W.
