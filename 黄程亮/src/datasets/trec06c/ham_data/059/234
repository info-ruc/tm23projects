Mark,

If you check out my contribution on this page, I have a servo driver that
runs on the port your peizo buzzer is connected to.

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/contrib.html

Even though the site is the Handy Board site, I have the software installed
and running on a Super TCOMP, which is a Rug Warrior look-alike.

Good Luck,

Gary Livick
