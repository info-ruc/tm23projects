I find that the ideal solution to this situation is to build a power system 
for the robot. Maxim, Linear Technology, and National each make very easy 
to use switching regulators that can provide highly efficient DC to DC 
conversion. Building a circuit out of the National "simple switcher" parts 
is pretty each. Then build on 5V supply for the HB, one 9V for the Lego 
motors, and run the camera of the 12V of the battery.
