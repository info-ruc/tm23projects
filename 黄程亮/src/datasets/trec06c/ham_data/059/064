The motor doesn't work in my program, which has multiple processes running,
but it still doesn't work when i just send the command through IC's
interactive window: motor(1,50).  Nothing special happens except for both
lights coming on.  The motor is just a lego motor, but i have been using it
for about a year without any problems.
I also found out that only the green light comes on, and at a lowered
intensity as it is supposed to, when i try the command without a motor plugged
in.


Thanks,
