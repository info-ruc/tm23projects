No this registry key didn't exist before hand.

For the RecordVocal problem I tried with <id "Clavier"> <id "DigitalVOX"> 
<id "RecordVocal">
  but then I have a lot of display problem
  (video flips and moved into video xx ticks later) only if the subject is 
responding fast (or if I'm in diagnostic mode). I thought that the 
requestscheduled instruction should prevent this. And I don't have this 
problem anymore if I suppress the RecordVocal answer.
