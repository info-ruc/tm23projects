I am a new user of handy board. I use handy board based on Mac. After I
download Handy_Board_v1.2.icd, do I need to download any other thing to handy
board? Now the basic function like fd(3), ao() works, but the expend function
like sonar does not work. I saw that my co-worker let sonar worked before, so I
don't know if I lost something.

How to download pcode_hd.s19?
