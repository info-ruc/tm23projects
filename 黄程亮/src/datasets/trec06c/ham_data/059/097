I had the same problem.  The servo would run fine if the program was not
doing anything else.  But if I was updating the pwm to the motor ports then
the servo would jitter.  I figured it was because the extra overhead was
screwing up the timing on the signal wire to the servo. I solved it by
placing a relay on the servo power wire.  The relay is powered by a digital
output.  So I usually change the servo position in software first, ie servo5
= 4000, then turn on the servo power by setting the digital output high,
wait for about 1 sec, then turn the servo power back off.  I was very happy
with this solution because it eliminated the jitter problem and also removed
any battery drain due to the servo at idle.  I found that the servo had more
than enough holding torque on its own with no power due to the large gear
ratio.

I did this but it didn't help.  *sigh*

Thanks for the tip!
