I believe someone asked a similiar question to this but I didn't get an
answer (I don't think).

Question relating to the HB expansion board and servo control (or lack of
same).

I can control standard servos (S148, 3003 etc.) just fine, they run as
expected from the hb servo ports.  But if I hook up micro-servos (using
Hobbico Command Mini-Servo CS-31) they are very unpredictable.  I can get
them to steady off to one side but if I move them around much they chatter
alot and will jump to random places.  Are the values supposed to be
radically different from standard sized servos?  I'm using values from
1000-3000 which seem to place them somewhat correctly but every so often
they'll rotate from one extreme to the other without reason.

Anyone have a similiar problem or know what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,

Jim M.
