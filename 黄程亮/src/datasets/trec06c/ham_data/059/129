I interfaced my Vector2X to the handyboard without using the SPI port and
without any machine language.  I set the compass to be in slave mode and used
three digital outputs on the expansion board to control the RESET, SCLK, and
SS lines.  I used another two digital inputs to read EOC and SDO.

The driver software is written in IC and is pretty short.  It's just a direct
implementation of the procedure given in the manual.

I'm thinking about rewriting this in assembly, but there doesn't seem to be
much point to it.  Most of the time is spent waiting for the compass to
generate a reading after you request the heading.  Another cool thing is that
you can just make a loop that constantly reads the compass and spawn this off
as an IC process.  It'll sit in the background and update a heading variable
for you.

One caveat about this method is that IC isn't fast enough to catch the least
significan bit of the compass reading, but I run the compass in the low res
mode, so I really don't care.

The SPI port does exist on the on the expansion board, mine has an empty spot
for a connection to a polaroid sonar, I think.

As far as the IR sensors, I'm using the analog readout ones.  They're great.
I've got five of them on my robot.

Let me know if you want my code for the compass and I'll spruce up the comments
and send it to you.
