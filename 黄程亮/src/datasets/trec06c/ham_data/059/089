If you are not conversant in assembly, it will be difficult to obtain code for
each individual digital port unless you get someone to write it for you
specifically.

However, if you switch to GP2D12 sensors, and remove the pullup resistors on the
Handy Board's analog ports, then you can load all the analog ports with sensors
and read them directly.  The GP2D12 puts out an analog range signal.  Its faster,
cheaper, and takes up lots less computer overhead.  Just read an analog port when
you want to check the range.  I think this new sensor kind of makes the GP2D02
obsolete for anyone with A to D capability on their controller.
