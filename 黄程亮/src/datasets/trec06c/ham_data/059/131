The Electronic Surplus Dealer Goldmine, http://www.goldmine-elec.com/,
has been selling some weather balloon electronics innards for a few
years. On this board there are some relevant sensors: a thermistor,
some sort of barometric chip and a humidity "device".=20
The humidity "device" is a plate of glass which appears to be covered
in what looks like carbon dust. There are clip-on leads on each end of
the glass. As the humidity changes, the resistance of this plate
changes. Its quite sensitive, changing rapidly by just breathing on it
from a distance.
  With these sensors, you can figure out the temperature and humidity
experimentally. I haven't been able to find any source on the web that
lists the pin outs for the barometric chip though.

Cheers,
