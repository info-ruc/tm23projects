  More info for Borris.  If you wan the next item to be presented as
rapidly as possible put a single Delay in the parameter line with a value
of -2, that will schedule the item for two ticks after everything has been
assembled.  You could use -1 but that might fail occasionally.  And the
other thing, your design specifies a delay for each item, I've just looked
at the code for Delay within an item (as opposed to on the parameter line)
and it's pretty useless unless it's in the first frame of an item, in fact
I don't recommend it's use at all, I'd call the code broken.
