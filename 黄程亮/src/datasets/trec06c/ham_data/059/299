I'm trying to use my handyboard to send MIDI messages to a host. I
downloaded and tried the MIDI libraries from Colby Leider, and it looks
like it's just what I need, but I can't get them to work with IC 2.8. Is
anyone using the Handyboard with MIDI, with the MIDI libraries or
otherwise?

Thanks a lot!
