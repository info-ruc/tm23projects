  You probably need to get better drivers for your sound card.  Although
the error indicates that another process is responsible (not my fault, I
don't write those error messages, blame M$) my guess is that when the
drivers are not adequate no process can get DirectSound access to the card,
although regular Windows sound requests may well still function.  The odd
thing is is that call is not even asking for a priority level (the next one
does that) so for it to fail there is most unusual, perhaps the
configuration is hopelessly screwed up.  Perhaps you only have MSDOS
drivers installed which win32 can use but DirectX cannot -- I say this
because I think that almost any windows drivers are usable by DirectSound
in the dreaded "emulated" mode, to find one not usable is indeed very special.

  You might want to run / Program Files / DirectX / Setup / DxDiag and use
the Sound / Test DirectSound button and see what happens.
