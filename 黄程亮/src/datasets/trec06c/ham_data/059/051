Hello all, 
	
	I have a project upcoming that would benefit from speech
recognition.  I have seen the voice direct by Interactive Speech and was
thinking of integrating it into my robot.  If anyone has had any success
(or failure) with this product or any other similar product, please let me
know.

Thank you
Sonny Mounicou
