All of the IR sensors I've seen use a pulsed IR emitter so that the
detector can distinguish between the emitted IR and ambient (e.g.
sunlight).

Some sensors simply measure the intensity of reflected IR, but this
method doesn't work reliably unless everything in the robot's
environment has the same IR reflectance; it would work ok in a maze
where all the walls have the same color and texture, for example, but
not so well in the typical home environment.

The more sophisticated IR sensors use some sort of triangulation scheme
where the spacing between the emitter and detector becomes important,
but I don't know the details of this method. Perhaps someone else on
the mailing list can shed more electromagnetic radiation on this.
