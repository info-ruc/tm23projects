Hi,

This question is not HB specific, sorry about that. I have bought a CCD
camera board, and I want to add it to my robot together with a TV
transmitter, the problem is that the camera has not built in audio, so I
will like to know if someone has a circuit that can amplify the signal from
an Electret mic to the levels that are used in the Audio In of a TV, or VCR,
I believe the Audio In works with a level of 150 mV, but I'm not sure about
that.

Thank You.

Jose Luis
