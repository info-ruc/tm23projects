Subject: Higher voltage for HB battery
To: "Handy Board mailing list" <handyboard@media.mit.edu>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I would like to know whether the HB can be used with a 12 V (ten AA
cell) NiCd battery instead of the standard 9.6 V (eight AA cell) NiCd
battery.

Specifically,
(1) Would the HB be damaged by the higher voltage,
(2) Would the HB function properly (e.g., could I still use Lego gear
motors), and
(3) Could I use a 14 or 15 V, 500 mA "wall wart" instead of the
standard 12 V, 500 mA adapter to charge the 12 V battery using the HB's
built-in charging circuitry (the two trickle charge modes and the ZAP
mode).

The reason that I would like to do this is that I have a video camera
and transmitter that requires 12 V, and I would like to avoid using
separate batteries (and especially separate charging circuits) for the
HB and the camera.

If anyone knows the answers, I would be grateful to hear about it.
Thanks in advance!

Sincerely,
-- Will Bain
