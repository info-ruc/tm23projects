I'm in the process of putting together a little C library that can be used
to build handyboard applications with Stephane Carrez's GCC port
(http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html).

If anyone has any suggestions or code contributions they would like to
make, I'd be happy to hear about it.  At this point I'm building in
low-level access to the various board features (LCD, sensor inputs, etc),
but I hope to tackle more complex things like a software PWM system for the
motors as well.  I don't plan to rewrite IC.  :-)
Thanks,
  -Matt
