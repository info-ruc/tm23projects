just to be clear, there are two types of LEGO sensor:  active and
passive:

* passive -- touch sensor, temperature sensor.
* active -- light sensor, rotation sensor (aka shaft encoder, angle sensor)

without expansion board, the HB can only deal with the passive
sensors.

with expansion board, you also can use the active sensors.  the active
sensors are somewhat sophisticated, you alternately charge them to +9v
and then read back their value.  this must be done repeatedly -- the
HB does it at 250 hz -- to maintain counts with the rotation sensor.
