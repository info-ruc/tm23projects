the rest of the functions are implemented in assembly by the pcode
interpreter, therfore they wont have an entry in lib_hb.c. To use them, just
call them as documented in the manual.

If you look at the functions for enabling/disabling these items in lib_hb.c,
you'll see that they simply toggle a bit in memory. There is a byte (or
possibly a 16bit int) that is used to define what is active. If you grab the
pcode source, you can find the meaning of each bit and modify lib_hb.c to
have the additional functions.
