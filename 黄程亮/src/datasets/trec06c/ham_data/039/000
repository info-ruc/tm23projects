I too would really like to use a Mini Hard-Drive on my Handy Board robot.
http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/library/micro/whitepap/whitepap
.htm
Camera's and Mobile Phone use micro-controllers, don't they?
Can a HC11 write/access data to/from HD sectors?

If anyone out there has any idea's or info, be sure and let us know.

Muchas Gracias,
Shan O.
