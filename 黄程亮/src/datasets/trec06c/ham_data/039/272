Hello.  I attempted to use the polaroid sonar device which is plugged into
my expansion board on my handy board.  I loaded the sonar.c file from the
handy board web site using IC.  When I called the routines in the sonar.c I
got a "tick" sound and an odd number.  This would happen every time the
sonar device was called and even though the device was never moved the
value always changed -- sometimes it would be negative and sometimes I
would get a "-Power Glitch-" on the handy board LCD.  Anybody know why it
is going this?  Thanks in advance.
