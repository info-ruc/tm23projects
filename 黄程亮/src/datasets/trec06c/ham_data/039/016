Anyone who wants to join is welcome...

My idea is to provide kids with materials to build their own musical
instruments, which can be played using techniques borrowed from various
percussion instruments, the didgeridoo (an Australian wind instrument -- 
see http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~guy/yidaki.html), and many others.  Sounds
may also be generated electronically with a small speaker and modified by
the player's actions.

This would allow kids to create their own music by connecting varying
lengths of tubing that slide inside each other (for different resonances,
echo effects, or a "talk-box" effect), as well as giving them control over
the electronics.  For example, a small microphone could pick up a kid's
voice, modify it, and send it to a speaker(s) that is part of the
instrument.

I already have most of the supplies I will need to do this project, so now
comes the fun part (coming up with ideas for things to construct)!  Also, 
I will likely be helping Saul with the musical kites (and I thought 
Jason's musical jungle gym was interesting as well..)

I will be traveling from the 15th until the 28th, so unfortunately I will 
not be in class next week. Please send me email if you have any questions!
