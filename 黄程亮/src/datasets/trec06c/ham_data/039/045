My idea is to develop a kit of 1-1.5 foot long bars and corner joints that
can be used to build a jungle gym.  Each bar has a way of detacting impact
and stress, and a way to transmit this signal through the bar network to a
computer.  The computer integrates information from the bars and uses it to
manipulate or generate music.

Ideally I'd like as flexible an architecture as possible, so kids could
choose to have a simple mapping (tap the bar to make a single percussion hit
or note); they could have little musical clips/sequences that could be
played over top of one another; or they could manipulate aspects of
constantly playing sounds/phrases.  There's a lot of interesting thought and
design to go into how the pattern of stress distributed through the
structure gets mapped onto musical manipulation.  I'm particularly
interested in thinking about organic and intuitive music manipulation.  When
laypeople listen to music they think of it in terms of emotion, intensity,
color, and intricacy rather than meter, rhythm, key, etc.  I think of the
challenge as being akin to developing the musical equivalent of translating
RGB color to HSB.

I like this idea a lot because it includes elements of construction,
programming (to tune the musical interface), and creative expression.

Saul mentioned the inexpensive stress sensors used in building bridges; if
there are any other technologies around the lab that could help I'd love to
hear about them.
