Are you sure it is no longer available??

There are more than a few substitutions available to you. For nstance, 
Kemet manufactures appropriate tantalum capacitor substitutions. There 
are a few that would meet your needs. 

Lets look at an appropriate replacement part number: Kemet 
T350A475K006AS may be obtained from JACO Electronics, Inc. There are 
other Kemet replacements with slight differences in characteristics 
specifically case size and series that would be appropriate. 

The part number broken down: T 350 A 475 K 006 A S

The first 2 digits of the 4th group of numbers are the significant 
picofarad code. Specific to Kemet, this series should always be 475 for 
your application (475 refers to 4.7). The 5th reference "K" is the 
capacitance tolerance (K= +/-10%, M= +/-20%, J= +/-5%), K would be 
preferable, M is acceptable and J is next to impossible to find. The 6th 
group of numbers is Kemets reference to 6.3v (006 refers to 6.3v).

Sterling, Pioneer, Arrow PEMCO are just a few of other possible sources 
of Kemet tantalums. You may also want to cross reference Nichicon which 
can be found at:
