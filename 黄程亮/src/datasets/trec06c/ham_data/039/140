Subject: musical narrative wearable construction kit

I propose:

a number of wearable pads which students can wear while acting in a scene.

The sensory input from these pads would be first recorded in a dress
rehearsal.  The students would then analyze the input from their pads
(matched to their body movements) and assign music to patterns they find.
For example, if they crawl around on all fours, they might add some
pizzicato "twinkle toes" music.

Students would work together to create pieces of narrative music for their
characters' physical movements.

I plan to implement the project using crickets, and a good deal of padding
so kids can crawl around whilst wearing the pads.  The pattern matching
program will be written in Java.

Further directions include: making programmable set pieces, and interactive
pads which respond to other pads' cues.

I welcome anyone's interest in the project.  Thanks!
