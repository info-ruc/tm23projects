  I use NiMh batteries with my HB. Works fine, but I would be careful
charging them. Supposedly these batteries require special charge circuits,
but I've always found a slight (<150mA) trickle charge to work fine. Maxim
(and others) make IC's for building special charging circuits but when I
switched my cell phone to NiMh I didn't buy a new charger! I wouldn't try
to quick charge (>500mA) them... Also, if you're running high current
motors off of the same battery pack be aware that they *cannot* supply the
current of an equivalent nicad pack.

Hope this helps, Duncan
