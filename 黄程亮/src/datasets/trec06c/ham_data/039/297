Umm, not sure which 'pulses' you're refering to. How are you generating the
pulses and what are they for? Do you mean the PWM going to the motor
drivers? The HB can generate lots of different pulses 8^]

 and for question 2, i mean is
>there any command to executed 2 functions at the same time.(eg: testmotors()
>and testdigitals())

try:

start_process(testmotors());
start_process(testdigitals());

this starts each function as a seperate process...

When running more than one process, you should know that some actions (like
printing to the LCD and IR communication) take significantly more processor
cycles which can *really* slow things down if you're not careful.

Hope this helps, Duncan
