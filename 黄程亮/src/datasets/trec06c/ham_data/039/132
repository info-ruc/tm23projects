Normally capacitors with values less than 1uF will not have a
polarity. They can go in either way. 

>does the label go in towards the max232 or out towards the edge?

Doesn't matter.  I try to make all the labels face the same way when I
build a board.  It makes things look better, but it is only for
aesthetics, nothing functional. If you are mounting something really
close to another component, you might want the labels facing out. That
way troubleshooting can be easier, since you won't have to bend (and
possibly damage) a component to read it's value.
