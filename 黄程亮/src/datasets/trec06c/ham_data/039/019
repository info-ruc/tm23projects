I would like to create multiple serial outputs (like 3 or 4) using the
digital outputs on the handyboard expansion board.  The purpose is to
drive an external servo controller and external motor controllers
(motorminds) which can handle more load than the handyboard's drive can.
2400bps operation would work fine.


Questions:

-has anyone tried this - is there any fundamental reason why it couldnt be
 done?

-any code available? (some mod of the Pa7_9600 code?)



thanks for any info,
