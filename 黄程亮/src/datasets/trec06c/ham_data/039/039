Hi

We just built a IR detection with a Radio Shack IR LED and their
Sharp detector GD1U..whatever....cost a few dollars.  Basically
detects anything within about 60 cm, depending on what surface you
are reflecting off of.  We found that we had to shield the detector
from direct emission from the LED with Aluminum foil..You can
adjust the sensitivity by looking at the detector count rate.  Also
the detector has to be hooked up to port 7  (I am not sure why ).
Works great and very easy to set up.
