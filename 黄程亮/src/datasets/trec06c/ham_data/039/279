I had similar problems until I installed the .1uF capacitor at C7 on the 
sonar board as mentioned in the documentation for the use of the sonar 
device with the expnsion board.  Edgar Leatherman, another handy board 
afficianado, was kind enough to point this out to me, and I'm passing on 
the favor.

While the silk screen seems to call for an electrolytic, I had trouble 
finding one at Radio Shack, so I settled for an old, spare, albeit 
larger, mylar component.  As soon as I soldered it to the sonar board at 
C7, everything worked fine.
