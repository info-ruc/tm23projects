Dear Guys,

          It just so happens that I remembered that I have four old but
still is good condition Ni-MH battery packs from an old cellphone, each pack
is rated at 4.8V and 600mAh and the weight of all four of them is just about
75% the weight of the NiCads that came with the HB. They also fit exactly
into the HB battery case. I was wondering if it would be alright if I
replaced the NiCads with the NiMH batteries. It would be really great if I
could since it would make the HB lighter and I dont have to wait until the
batteries are fully discharged before recharging them again. Any comments of
this idea of mine would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.


F.Samonte
