Great ! I thought no one could have done or imagined something like. The
problem, I belive, is that no massive memory storage device (massive: about
1Mb or 2, or 512 KB ...) has an input that can be interfaced with the
handyboard or with another 68hc11 boards. Meanwhile, where can I find the
pinout
of such  a standard device like a floppy ? And then, can the board drive
all the memory of the new device ? And if I have a BUS on my board ?
