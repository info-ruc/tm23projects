Subject: Good source for Lego Technic parts?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Somewhat off topic:

I'm looking for a good source of basic Lego Technic parts (beams, gears,
axles, etc.) for robot construction. I'm not really interested in
particular kits with specialized parts like the motorcycle, forklift, and
such-- I just want a good assortment of Technic gears and parts. What's a
good place to find this stuff?

I checked etoys.com and toysrus.com, but both had very limited selections
of Lego Technic sets. I also checked out Pitsco, which is mentioned on the
Handy Board web site, but they don't appear to have a general Technic
starter set either.

If anyone knows of a good source for these parts, or the Lego kit number of
a good starter set, please let me know.

Thanks!
--Steve
