This may be more the speed of a hobby than a toy, but here goes--
Interactive hydroponic garden: A self-encapsulated lucite hydroponic growing 
environment, complete with starter seeds, would allow kids to watch their 
plants growing up as well as down at the same time.  The planter base would be 
a motorized lazy susan which could be programmed (via IR port and external PC) 
to spin towards the brightest light source throughout the day.  It could also 
be set to chime audio alerts when the container is low on water or other 
nutrients.  The PC port connection would also allow kids to export sensor data 
about the water and air in their garden. In doing so periodically, they could 
compare measures of growth against light, nutrient and CO2 levels to determine 
optimal conditions.  The PC software would then allow them to connect to a 
Web-based virtual garden where they could easily upload info about their plant 
to "display" a virtual representation of it in a kids community garden online.
 A variety of areas at the Virtual Garden site could be developed to allow 
them to share ideas with other aspiring eco-culturists.

If no one else shares interest in this though, I have a passion for music and 
would be very interested in helping to develop one of the existing musical 
ideas currently on the table.  In particular I like the flexibility of Erik's 
music pads for their open-ended play.  Dan's musical construction kit sounds 
quite cool too.  I like Jason's approach to the "Musical Jungle Jam" whereby 
how you play affects mood and color as opposed to meter and rhythm 
specifically.  And Saul's kites certainly would be a wonderful spectacle.

All these cross-modal projects (from motion to music) seem inherently 
interesting.  It might be cool too to explore how the visual modality (either 
in light pattern or color) might compliment a respective project.
