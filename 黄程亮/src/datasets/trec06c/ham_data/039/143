You are making a mistake in you addressing-mode.
You do a: STAB	TFLG1,X, where TFLG1 = $1023 and you initialise X=#$1000
The assembler gets confused and generates bogus output, including a warning.

You need to set TFLG1 EQU $23.

You need to so that with more of your definitions or change you address-mode
to:
	STAB	TFLG1

Get rid of your warnings and it should load ok.
Be sure to strip_cr you icb-file.
