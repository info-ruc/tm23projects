Hello Everyone,
I received the following e-mail from a student and since I'm not employed
in this field I thought
there might be someone on the list that could respond.  Please send your
e-mail address directly
to me so that I may forward it.
Thanks in advance,
Bob B.

 "I am doing an English class research project on the career of robotics.  
I would like information on becoming a robotics engineer and the life of 
a robotics engineer.  I am also looking for a robotics expert to 
interview.  If you can give me the email address of such a person, I 
would greatly appreciate it."
