Ja, a laptop would work. Even better, cheaper, why not use a good old
desktop coputer? Then you could just have the components you need, IE a
motherboard, a removeable video card, sound card, the amount of memory you
like, etc. Best of all, the HDD's are much cheaper and much more
drop-resistant that a laptop. Some of the newer drives boast being able to
accelerate to 70g's without any damage to the drive. You could pull the
motherboard out of the case too... add several parallel port cards, the
computer can adress more than one. Add a few serial cards, and a
computer-run video camera, etc. It should wind up a *LOT* cheaper than any
laptop out there, and you don't have an expensive LCD screen to bust (just
hook a monitor up to the Motherboard whil eprogramming it, detatch it
while the 'bot is running. Need something to monitor the computer?
Interface a  20x4 screen to the serial port....)
