  Okay, I'm having a conversation with a friend on mine on the phone who I
have told about M-B type theory.  Anyway, we were talking about another
friend of ours who is an INTP.  I said, "This guy is a QUIENTIESSENTIAL intp."
 And this friend replied, "But he's moody."
 I said, "Well, INTPs are moody.  There are a number of people on the INTP
list I'm on that are taking anti-depressants.  Some of the other ones that
aren't, probably should."
 Then he said, "Well, that implies that INTPs are deficient as a type."
 And I said, "What do you mean?"
 And he said, "Well, you're saying maybe they should improve to another type."
 And I said, "No.  INTPs are only losers in general.  Every so often, one
of them will do something amazing, like Newton inventing the laws of
motion, or Einstein discovering relativity, or Bill Watterson doing 'Calvin
and Hobbes.'"
 And he said, "You put Watterson up there with Newton?"
 "Yes, Watterson is more entertaining."
 "Newton wasn't funny?"
 "Newton was funny.  Just not ha-ha funny.  That time he ate all those
chemical compounds and got paranoid and accussed everyone of trying to kill
him was funny, though."
 "So, INTPs are losers."
 "No, see, since every so often one of them will do something amazing, on
average they aren't.  The mean of INTPs aren't losers, just the median."
 Then I added, "Should I send this to the mailing list?"
 And he said, "Why not?  INTPs aren't easily offended, right?"
