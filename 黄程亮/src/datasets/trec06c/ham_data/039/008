I had the same problem.  I tried everything, even replacing the CMOS 
memory chip, to no avail.  Since my board was purchased assembled from 
Gleason, I ultimately swapped them for a replacement which has been 
working perfectly.  I don't know whether they examined the defective unit 
after I returned it, but you might contact Wanda Gleason, and find out.  
I hope she won't mind my offering her assistance without checking with 
her first, that is, unless you, too purchased the board from Gleason 
Research.

Her email address is wmg@gleasonresearch.com
