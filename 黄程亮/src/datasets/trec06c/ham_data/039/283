Just a suggestion but you could mount a Hall effect sensor somewhere near a
rotating rounded part on the cage and glue a small piece of magnet to the
rounded part.  You could look for the pulse on a digital input.  This way it
would not add much weight.

Alternatively, you could replace your motor with an RC servo which is very
easy to center and whose center pulse width, once determined, could be
placed in your code.

And lastly, adding only a couple of ounces, you could purchase a linear pot
(say 50k) and have the motor drive it's shaft also.  Place a voltage across
the outer leads and measure the voltage across the wiper and ground when the
sonar is centered.  Hook it up to an analog port and adjust that way.  I
always flatten the wiper stop so it can rotate 360 degrees.

Hope these ideas help.
