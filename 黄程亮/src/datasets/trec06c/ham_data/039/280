I've rigged up a rotating cage holding the Polaroid 6500 transducer at 
the front of one of my bots.  Every time I turn on the handy board, I'd 
like the software to begin by centering the transducer facing forward.

I've rigged a micro motor to a bevel gear to drive the rotating sonar.  
The motor's axle passes through the Lego angle sensor.  The problem is 
that whenever the handy board is switched off, lego3_counts is reset to 
0, even if the sonar transducer is not facing directly forward.  
Persistent globals won't help, since they, too, are reinitialized when 
the handy board is switched on or the code is reloaded.

My bot is heavy enough already.  I'm loathe to add mechanical limit 
sensors to what is already a kludgy first attempt to get the whole thing 
working.

Any thoughts?
