thanz  Duncan for your advice. but for question 1, what i mean was to count
the number of pulses generated without any external device. what i am asking
is to count the number of pulses internally. and for question 2, i mean is
there any command to executed 2 functions at the same time.(eg: testmotors()
and testdigitals())

i will be thankful to u if u or anyone could offer any advices.

with regards,
Michael
