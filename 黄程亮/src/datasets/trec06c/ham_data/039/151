Subject: P6305 is obsolete?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Digi-Key told me that the mini axial 'lytic part #P6305 was obsolete.
What part can I use instead?  Has anyone had this happen?
also, my last message "help on obsolete part" had the wrong part i meant
the P6305 from digi-key.

-Jon
