I have considered something like that and it sure would work but I was
hoping to find a s/w based solution that didn't require changing the h/w.

I only need outputs, 2400bps, and I dont need any of the more functional
aspects of typical serial parts (like hw flow control).

There are so many servo and motor controller gadgets in use now that I
find having several serial outputs to be desirable.
