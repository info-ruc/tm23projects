Original 'autonomous' robot inventor was Grey WALTER , circa 1948 - - an
American neurologist from Kansas who affiliated all his life with a university
? in England. From there it took some 20 years before BROOKS of MIT formalized
the teaching of robotics at the USA university level. The modern day 'Diety'
is Fred MARTIN/PhD - circa 1992 to the present - of MIT's Media Lab. [See his
many many excellent dissertations on every and ALL aspects of bot technology -
- - constructs/Hi-power ICB's/Intercative programming/ annual contests/MIT
courses/et al.] 
NASA web sites have ALL about MARS/et al space probes, landers and rovers. The
DISCOVERY web-site will lead you to everything you would possibly want to know
and/or include in your paper.
Two others I would recommend contacting are Mike GASPERI [Wisc] & Peter
Couseneau {U of Montreal}. - - - See the three CC:s
I live in the Washington DC metro area -near Dulles airport -and have seen one
of WALTER's original second generation bots at the Smithsonian Institute
museum.
I suggest at the very beginning of your research you distinguish between
external
human-controllable bot types AND autonomous reflexive/speculative bot types
like WALTER's - - - you may even find that one OR the other is enough for you
to handle in your paper [depends on how many pages you are assigned to write']
I am a HS Sci physics teacher using contemporary LEGO MindStorms to teach +
Nasa-sponsored annual HS stu BotBall competitions.
Would be more than willing to provide the stu w/ any AND all more refs as
he/she sees fit.
