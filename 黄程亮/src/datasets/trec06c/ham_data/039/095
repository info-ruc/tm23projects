Steve:

I bought a kit of parts from Lego to build the first robot mentioned in
the mobile robot book by Jones and Flynn.  I don't remember the kit
number but I purchased the kit from the Lego Dacta division.  You might
try calling them to get a catalogue.  The number give for Customer
Support is 1-800-527-8339.
