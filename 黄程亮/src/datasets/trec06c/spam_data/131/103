DiCaprio to Play Theodore Roosevelt
Source: Variety September 12, 2005
Paramount Pictures has optioned the Pulitzer Prize-winning Edmund Morris boo
k The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and will develop it for Martin Scorsese to 
direct and Leonardo DiCaprio to star as the 26th U.S. president, reports Var
iety. Nicholas Meyer (The Human Stain) is writing the script.
The film will chronicle the formative years of Roosevelt as he reinvented hi
mself from a slight and privileged New York politician with a Harvard degree
 to the burly commander of the Rough Riders, a track that would lead him to 
the New York governorship, the vice presidency and the White House, when Wil
liam McKinley was assassinated.
DiCaprio and Scorsese are in the midst of their third film together, The Dep
arted, the Warner Bros. remake of the Hong Kong crime drama Infernal Affairs
. The duo also made Gangs of New York and The Aviator together.
