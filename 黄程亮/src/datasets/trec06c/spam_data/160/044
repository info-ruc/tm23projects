不要嫌烦哦：）
Part One:
 
Once there was a piggie named Leopold. he was a very young and fat American pig who loved many piggy things.  One day he went on a trip to Europe to study an acient pig language.  On the way to that European Pigland, he met a very adorable piggie from a far away land, named Miss Cow.  She was studying Food Design at the top piggie university in her land.  On the flight they talked about many piggie things, before falling in love with each other.  Of course, the piggie had never met a pig from America before, and she didnt really like America, so she couldn\'
t believe how she could love this pig...She always loved other kinds of pigs before...
 
The American pig, was a very interesteing pig and came from a Jewish Pig family.  He always liked other pig lands and other pig cultures...For him, Miss Cow was the most lovely piggie he had ever seen.  he couldnt believe he could ever meet such a beautiful piggie, not even in his pigged out dreams.  he had never had a girlfriend before, and had always wanted one. 
 
\\By the time, the airplane landed Miss Cow and Leopold talked a very long time.  Miss Cow and leopold were both going to the top Pig University in the world to study abroad and look for good piggie work.  Miss Cow wanted to be a flying food designer and Leopold wanted to be a baby pig book writer and little piggie teacher.  Little did these two pigs from other sides of the world know that they would later really fall in love and become pig husband and piggie wife.
 
They had become good friends though and exchanged phone numbers for the dorms that they would be staying in and planned to get together the next day to go piggieback riding with eachother, accross Piggie Land.
 
That day Miss Cow went to her dormatory where she met lots of beautiful piggies from all over the world who were all studying many different piggie things at the piggie university and all could speak many different piggie languages.  They of course all had fun like all little pigs should and sopet the whole night eating and sleeping with eachother and watching lots of naughty  piggie movies about piggie love and othe rthings for very colored pigs...
 
Leopold was very lonely that night. he had never been to anothe rpig land before.  He didnt go back to his dormatory that night and spent that day alone. He walked around the Pig City and looked around all over. Every now and then, he would stop to eat piggie food or stop at a bar to drink piggie beer.  He was very sad and piggie home sick.  At the same time, he was always lonely.  He didnt have a very good piggie family and also never had very many piggie friends...He had hoped, that by coming to this new Pig Land, he could learn many new things about his piggie life and become a happier and better pig.  
 
He thought of that wonderful and lovely piggie he had met on the plane earlier as he was walking down a piggie bar street late that night. It was called Pigg Li Tun.  On thgis street there were many rich and many very bad pigs and many street-girl piggies.  He of course didnt like any of them. He just walked alone and went from bar to bar, having drinks until he was so piggy drunk, he threw up on a rich pig man that was next to him.  The throw up smelled so bad, that the rich pig died from it. He was drinking beer with many street piggies around him.  He burped with a loud snort and then fell over the beer flying in the air.  The street pigs all jumped on him at once, and tore off his clothes.  then they ran away with all of the rich pig\'
s money.
 
Leopold was shocked...He couldn\'t believe something like this could ever happen in a pig land...
