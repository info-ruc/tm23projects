     都说上面题简单,我还是要错不少:(
     大家一般一篇错多少啊
ShiChunZhen\'s reading 220 is the worst ever , if not trash . Perhaps , it is fair that we call it worthless or overvalued by some students who is not good at english . I suppose, somebody believes Shi\'s is not-so-bad more because of the propaganda than of real stuff .  As is mentioned above , you can take my word , if you are at high level in english , mabe , it\'s no harm to have a try ; but , if your english is not good enough to do something beyond what the OUTLINE requires , it\'s for sure previous year\'s test papers are good enough for u .  
    gooooooooooood luck
