Part 3
One day, the Mr. Pig went back to his own pig country.  He was very sad to leave his beloved piggie, but he had no choice.  The pig\'s study visa was about to expire and the pig had no money, because his piggy family wouldn\'t support him.  The pig and his Miss Piggy were very sad.  The pig new that he would be back to his love as soon as he could, but the Miss Piggy, wasn\'t so sure.  In fact she really loved Mr. Pig, but she was so scared.  
In fact Miss Piggy and Mr. Pig had been together almost 5 months.  They had had many fights and problems, in addition to all their romance and happy piggy adventures.  Both Mr. pig and Miss Piggy were a little crazy...Before, Miss Piggy, thought that Mr. Pig was a colored pig and just wanted to use her for piggy sex. In fact, she was wrong...
Since she thought Mr. Piggy was a colored pig at first, she wasnt so serious and didnt see herself as really mr. pig\'s girlfriend.  So the colored Miss Piggy would go out with many other colored pigs every night and always leave her Mr. Pig alone to go dancing with other pigs...and to their apartments...
This of course made Mr. Pig so angry...and even more crazier...so everytime Miss Piggie did this, he would cry soooo much and have a broken piggy heart. furthermore, him and Miss piggy would have very big piggie fights. The Miss Piggie would go poo poo at Mr Pig\'s apartment and go pee pee on his bed.  Also, she would eat all of his piggie food and try to wear all of his piggie clothes...also, she would try to bite off his manly piggy meat...
Of course the Mr. Pig also would do bad things...He would always try to go into the Piggie girls dormatory with Miss Piggy and see all of her beautiful piggy roommates...and also he would use all of Miss Piggie\'s money and eat all of her Piggie food.  He even called up her Piggie mommy and grandma and told them all the very bad piggy things that Miss Piggy did...and when Miss Piggy was the worst to Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, went crazy and started hitting Miss Piggy with his very big piggy fat...until Miss Pig would cry and be in so much pain...
In fact all of miss piggy\'s roommates hated mr. pig...and always told miss piggy to leave him...but miss piggy really loved the fat pig and the fat pig really loved her...\'
one day, all the problems stopped.  the pig and piggy stopped fighting. when they were together they were only happy.  before the pig left the piggy land, it was just like this.  everyday they were together. they ate food, they cuddled together,  they made lots of piggy love together and went around the local piggy town together and even bought lots of really cool piggie things...\'
when the pig went back to  his native piggy land, the miss piggy swore to be loyal to him and never to betray and leave him...they swore to be perfect piggy loves forever...
\'well, only 11 days later on the anniverserary of that big bad wolf ben larden, Miss Piggy betrayed her love...she put an ad. for a new Mr Pig on the Pighua University website...Well, Mr. Pig found out and was so hurt and crazy. he wanted to die and his heart was so broken...he couldnt believe his pig who he loved and trusted so much had betrayed him...
\'worse, when he called his love and his piggie, she only said very bad things to him...about how she couldnt love him because she wasnt italian...and that he wasnt a good piggie in bed...and how he was just too stupid and too fat...
\'Well, Mr. Piggie was more hurt and more heart broken than any other pig in the world had ever been before...he was about ready to do the worst thing in the world to himself that any pig could do...because he hurt so much...and couldnt stand to live without his true piggy love.  the one pig he loved and wanted to be with so much...
