 我写的一篇essay,大家帮忙看看,U of TEXAS-Austin要求的,大家多提宝贵意见,指出一些语法错误,谢谢了.发在别的版没人搭理.
Topic:
Many students expand their view of the world during their time in college. Such growth often results from encounters between students who have lived different cultural, economic, or academic experiences. With your future growth in mind, describe a potential classmate that you believe you could learn from either within or outside a formal classroom environment.
My essay:
                             Let the love fill in the china
    In contemporary China,society generally gauge a person by his wealth or status,no matter the way he acquires them.so there are common that university students\'s upper goal are to make money and success ,never considering of his contribution to others and the society.Many people say there is absence of conscience and morality in modern chinese people,for we often head some one who was heavily sick lay on the busy street,but no one passing by helped to sent him to hospital and then he dead wretchedly.
    After Mao found his socialism regime, all the chinese believed in Marxism crazily. After many years especially the CULTURE REVOLUTION , millions of people died of hungry and political persecution, then Den Xiaopin assumed the reins of government and reformed the entire political and economic system.chinese people found they had been entirely blinded by the CCP government and no one believe in Marxism any longer.The tradition moral system of ancient china society was completely destroyed by CULTURE REVOLUTION and they don\'t believe the Marxism ,so chinese now can only believe in money.
    About two years ago,I met an American student in Tsinghua and we became good friend soon.One day,I complaint to him a friend of mine did harm deed to me even after I helped him.But he told me I should forgive him and even love him, no matter how he had treated me,and you should even love your enemy.I was shocked that moment especially when my eye met his mild eye.he left for a rural country in china after a short stay in Beijing ,teached poor students english voluntary for free and donated some books to them.he was the firt person teaching me what\'s good morality and there exists love in the  world .
    I wish to meet such a guy in University of texas-Austin.he is  friendly and always willing to help others.he often do voluntary works in community,and often tutors classmate with study difficulties. He invites me to his family ,leting me feel the warms of family in foreign country.When suffering  misunderstanding,he always smiles to it .he let me feel the power of good character and personality,the loveness in human society and let me know what\'s morality and conscience by action.After the invaluable experiences in United states ,I would take my feeling and reflection back to China ,and influence the  people around me ,that is taking the love and kindness back to my motherland..
