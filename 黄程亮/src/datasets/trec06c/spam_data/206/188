突然发现，昨天，9月27日，由于一小群人(http://blog.yam.com/lifeshot/archives/
530747.html)的无端抗议，google map将其网站上
　
"Taiwan, Province of China"
　
中的"Province"移除，并在地图上和China同级别显示。

我不知道为什么会无端生出这样的事来，如果这就是民主的话，相信我们至少能够以同
样的方式把这样的错误改回来。
　
抗议方法：
　
一、点击http://www.google.com/support/maps/bin/request.py后选Suggestion
　
二、填上你的电子邮件地址，SUBJECT写上Object for removing Province from Taiwa
n
　
三、拷贝下面内容（或自己认为更合适的表述）到MESSAGE，然后按SUBMIT
　
Dear Google,
　
In your map listings, I noticed that you mistakenly removed "Province of Chi
na" from the list of Taiwan, maybe because of some people\'s weird mail-sugge
stion, on Sep 27 2005. It is not a good change. Please fix the display as th
e reasonable format.
　
Taiwan is NOT an independent nation. More than 161 countries in United Natio
nals claim that Taiwan is an integral part of China. Something such as curre
ncy, election, and funny government cannot uxtapose a province with its moth
er country. Whether some minority satisfy or not, a province of a country is
 much more appropriate than a nation by definition.
　
Although we all know Taiwan is a complex problem, anyway, we are a whole fam
ily. Listing Taiwan separated from China hostility is not good to the peace 
and stability of the large part of people and area in the world.
　
Google, as a venerable hi-tech company, what can change your represent hasti
ly without justness? Democracy? Minoral unreasonable remonstrate? I am sure 
we will have a much larger number of mail to show the right way.
　
Pease readd “Province of China” on the statement of Taiwan. And, do not di
splay Taiwan (Hongkong, Macro) with China together in the same screen resolu
tion (such as 1000km scale). Like the Hawaii and United States on your websi
te.
　
Thanks.
　
请大家团结起来，互相号召！
　
另外我的E文不大好，有需要改正的地方，还请大家指正。谢谢！

台湾最初的抗议信：
Dear Google,
In your map listings, I noticed that you mistakenly list Taiwan as a provinc
e of China. Please remove “Province of China” from the list of Taiwan.
Taiwan is an independent nation and does not consider itself a province of C
hina. The only country in the world that still thinks that Taiwan is a provi
nce of China is China. Other countries have kowtowed to China\'s fantasies, b
ut the reality is that Taiwan is a state with its own government, own electi
ons, its own currency and its own defined territory. Taiwan negotiates its o
wn treaties and has its own president. By definition, a province of a countr
y, can not and does not do this.
Taiwan does not claim to represent China, but China wrongly claims to repres
ent Taiwan. Listing Taiwan as a province of China is incorrect.
A country, such as China, regardless of how economically powerful, should no
t dictate to a venerable hi-tech company such as Google, what to write and h
ow to write it. As a hi-tech portal site, Google Maps, should strive to list
 the truth. This listing of Taiwan as a province of China, smacks against th
is principle.
Again, please remove “Province of China” from the list of Taiwan.
Thanks.
