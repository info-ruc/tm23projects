         Developing New Products in Half the Time

             外＜医淌诠省一半rg_l新a品

Introduction:

  Many Hong Kong manufacturers start to re-position 
 their businesses from OEM to ODM or even OBM due to the “limited
 &open profit margin” businesses and the global competitive 
 environment.  Successfully developing your own products shall
 provide high value-added services to your customers, which in turn
 improve overall profitability and strengthen competitiveness of 
 your business in the long run.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
About this workshop:

   Many firms have learned how to develop products in half or less 
 of the time it formerly took them.  Some are even more aggressive:
 Motorola, for example, has an objective to speed its development 
 by 10X.  Simultaneously, companies are forced to do more with 
 less.  Some managers erroneously see time to market as a ploy to 
 get more work out of their people, and others are worried that 
 speeding up the process could mean skipping steps and compromising
  product quality.

   This two-day workshop allows you to build a durable rapid 
 development capability that fits your company.  You will learn 
 that not all projects should be accelerated and that you should 
 have a range of speed capabilities that can be applied selectively,
 depending in the needs of the specific project.Our approach is 
 solidly based on improving your business profitability.  We show 
 how to calculate and apply the cost of delay and compare it to the 
 cost of omitting a product feature, exceeding your manufacturing 
 cost target, or overrunning your project expense budget.  Only when
 you know the cost of delay in dollars can you make wise choices 
 about cutting time from your schedule.

New Concepts of Product Development：

 ▲ Project economic Trade-offs, such as the cost of delay 

 ▲Proactive Risk Management on Product Development
 
 ▲Continuous Improvement of the Product Development Process 

 ▲Effective Cross-Functional Development Teams and the trade-offs involved in using them 

 ▲Co-located versus Dispersed (virtual) product development teams 

 ▲Iterative (non-sequential) product development processes

Who should attend?
 This workshop will provide value to Product / Marketing Managers 
and Developers involved in new product introductions who wish to 
accelerate or otherwise improve the effectiveness of their product 
development process. 
  The techniques offered apply to a wide range of industries (such as
 electronic, software, mechanical, and chemical) ranging from more 
 mature products to leading-edge computers, telecommunications, and 
 medical devices. We have found that the need to streamline the 
 development process often depends more on the speed of the company relative to its immediate   competitors that it does on the rate of change in its industry. 
 Thus the opportunities are just as great in more traditional 
 industries as they can be in the high tech field.
