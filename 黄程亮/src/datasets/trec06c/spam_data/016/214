Title:  A Signal Processing Approach to Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important imaging modality for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. However, MRI is still a relatively slow technique. State-of-the-art technology is capable of acquiring 3D images from static objects and 2D images from time-varying objects. It is desirable, for a number of applications, to develop "real-time" imaging capability. In this presentation, I will discuss a signal processing approach to fast imaging based on parallel data acquisition and generalized series reconstruction. I shall describe the associated data acquisition scheme and image reconstruction algorithm, and show some examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the new approach. In addition, I will give a brief introduction to the graduate education at the Electrical Engineering Department at Texas A&amp;M University,
