part two:
 
when the miss cow knew american pig faced so much trouble, she showed mercy on him, so she always go out with him and talk with him and tried to make him happy. as the time passing by, miss cow spent almost all her time on the american pig, she escaped fron her classes, and missed her homework, she even had no time to talk and see her italian piggies. so she blame on the american piggie, thought it s all his fault because he s too tupid and like to cry so much, doesn\'t like the male pig at all. so she decide to leave him... 
 
the first time when miss cow left Leopold, he cried so much, as miss cow was so stupid, she never saw a pig cry so she decide to stay.
the second time whenmiss cow left Leopold,he also cried, but it was useless to miss cow this time, so he stopped cry and use his piggie dance and piggie sad smile, he dance with miss cow in the pig bar, and later they drunk piggie beer, and in the very late night pig protected miss cow to go back to her school and pushed her bike. as miss cow s heart s so soft, she was moved by him, she stay with the pig again... 
 
and they had a very good time, they went to the park together, the american pig always look at miss cow when she drawing, and when they r walking they always hold each other s fat waist adn look at each other s face, and the american pig has a very horrible face which can make miss cow afraid, because he look like Ben.Larden who did 911 to the usa, and miss cow has a so lovely face that the pig always want to kiss even though he has so much bierd and make miss cow painful...
 
miss cow love mr pig s fat lovely lips, whenever they kiss, miss cow ll bite it and say: oh so delicious heheheheh...and smile looking at mr pig s so painful, and make a victory gesture:) but mr pig can do nothing to her because he love her too much, and he only can do whatever she like, so even after she bites him, he has to smile to her. 
 
and miss cow love ji chi so much so they always eat ji chi outside, even the piggie waitress know she just want ji chi, so every time when she come in the piggie restraunt she ll ask directly that how many ji chi u want and mr pig ll buy so many for her, until she can\'t eat any more and when he see the fat meat appear on her stomache.
