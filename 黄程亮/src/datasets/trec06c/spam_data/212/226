what u said is much too right,especially the last sentence.
I and my GF have experienced a long-distance relationship more than 2 years and felt deeply that each other just wish to see the "origin" one who won\'t change through the years(yet impossible).
So just relax and treat it as a kidding whisper.
:)
     hehe, take it easy, he cares u   :)
     it\'s a good news, right?
     In a long-distance relationship, people don\'t like change.
