报告摘要：
This talk outlines the emerging and the future wireless world, and discusses the technology/service evolution in an increasingly converged environment, in the next 1 to 8 years. It focuses on user-experience, new paradigms, technology/service innovations, global research, industry trends and standardization. 
A holistic view is outlined which includes an end-to-end understanding of how each of the building blocks (user interaction, converged open service environment, user device innovations and management, service enablers, core network, and mobile/nomadic access mechanisms) evolves, and how the entire picture serves, in phases, to enable the future mobile society. 
The vision of the future towards an increasingly user-centric and seamless access across smart user cyber-spaces is presented. Accordingly, an end-to-end perspective on key research topics of the coming years is shared, to encourage focus and collective energy for future research and innovations.
