   An     open     letter     to     American    President    Mr.    Bush
   ¾´ÖÂÃÀ¹ú×ÜÍ³²¼Ê²ÏÈÉúµÄ¹«¿ªĞÅ Hello, my respectable President Mr. Bush:
   The  fact  that  DuPont  declined  to  fulfill  the agreement has been
   presented  to you for several times via president@whitehouse.gov; As a
   result,  president@whitehouse.gov  sent  back three letters containing
   the  following  same  contents  on  the behalf of Mr. President in Sep
   2004:¡±Thank you for e-mailing President Bush. Your ideas and comments
   are very important to him.¡± My ¡±ideas and comments¡± are as follows:
   it  is verified by Mr. Huang with adequate facts and irrefutable legal
   evidences  that DuPont must disburse Mr. Huang patent fee, license fee
   or  equivalent  ¡°Utter  Compensation¡±  fee  and DuPont¡¯s persistent
   refusal  to  disburse  these  fees  infringes  upon  the  intellectual
   property rights of Mr. Huang. president@whitehouse.gov mentioned ¡±are
   very  important  to him.¡± I don¡¯t dare to unduly surmise the meaning
   of  ¡°very  important¡±  to  Mr.  President;  However, according to my
   humble  opinions,  there exits the following ¡°important¡±: on the one
   hand,  respectable  Mr.  President, the American Government led by Mr.
   President  as  well  as  the  great  American people bitterly hate the
   predation of the intellectual property rights of others through brazen
   means  such  as  stealing,  shameless  acts;  in  contrast,  DuPont is
   committing  such  brazen  and  shameless deals; on the other hand, the
   number of your country¡¯s intellectual property rights in a variety of
   fields  is  far  in  excess  of  that  of any nations in the world and
   suffers  greatly  from rights infringement. Therefore, your government
   always  reserves  no  efforts in urging other nations to intensify the
   law  enforcement  strength  to  protect  your  country¡¯s intellectual
   property rights. However, while your government reserves no efforts in
   urging  the  Chinese  government  to  intensify  the  law  enforcement
   strength  to  protect your country¡¯s intellectual property rights and
   receives  your  ¡°more encouraged¡± praise(note), DuPont is infringing
   the   intellectual  property  rights  of  Mr.  Huang  through  various
   extremely  brazen  and shameless means, which constitutes an extremely
   bad  signal  to  the  governments  and  public of other nations in the
   world, a extremely ¡°good¡± model for current and potential thieves of
   intellectual  property  rights,  an enormous damage to your government
   protection  of  your  country¡¯s  intellectual  property rights, and a
   tremendous  humiliation  to your country¡¯s lofty status in the world.
   For  the  sake  of  the  glory  of  the  great American people and the
   reputation of a legion of American corporations, in order to safeguard
   your country¡¯s lofty status in the world and protect the intellectual
   property  rights  of  your  country and other nations in the world, we
   humbly  request  you  and  your  government  to prevent DuPont¡¯s such
   extremely  brazen  infringement  and even seizure behaviors, and force
   DuPont  to  carry  out  it¡¯s  voluntarily promised obligations in the
   agreement.  We  firmly  believe that the United State is not a country
   that  shields  and  connives at rascals and the American government is
   not  a  government  that  shields  and  connives at rascals; Under the
   instruction   of  our  respectable  Mr.  President  and  the  American
   government,  the  rascal of DuPont shall be aware of shame and be able
   to  turn  into  a normal corporation by giving up shameless behaviors.
   Due to the adequate evidences, the clear-cut rights and obligations of
   both  parties of DuPont and Mr. Huang, and simple legal relations, the
   infringement  of  the  intellectual  property  rights  of Mr. Huang by
   DuPont can be absolutely prevented and DuPont will surely disburse Mr.
   Huang patent fee, license fee or equivalent ¡°Utter Compensation¡± fee
   as long as your government intensifies the law enforcement strength to
   protect  intellectual  property  rights  as  well.  With best regards!

   out  a  month-long insecticide screening on the third batch of samples
   (in fact, it has carried out weeds killing test and mould killing test

   June  8,  2000,  DuPont  sent a letter saying it was not interested in
