Maybe you can say, I have not realized it yet.
I must deem it myself, sothat we can treasure each other more in future.
Please wait me !
See you later!
     标  题: 出轨的诡异理由，我不能理解
     
     The truth is like this. I am a romantic and adventurous person beneath
     my seemingly peaceful look. I always fancy having a romantic
     experience in love. Besides, I like uncertainties in life. I mean
     excitement, boldness, restlessness and unconstraint in my blood. I
     long for exploration and experience. Therefore, because I have not had
     such experience in love, I just wanna try it. That is why I came close
     to xxx. Sorry for that, but I know now definitely that romantic
     fantasy is a totally different story from reality. And I know for sure
     that if I do not experience it, I maybe betray my dear loved one after
     marriage. In getting along with xxx, sometimes I indeed found romance,
     but more often than not, I sensed uneasiness, irresponsibility and
     lack of care and in life. This time I truly knew the price for the
     unrealistic so-called romance and I was somewhat happy that I realized
     this before marriage. So that is why I said \'miss you\' that day. I
     found that it is you that love me truly, deeply and sincerely. I knew
     clearly now that the difference between the boy that I hang out with
     and the one that I will spend rest of life with. I just deemed this
     experience as a lesson I learned from life, which I wanted to keep it
     as a secret.
     
     But now, since you have known the thing, I just want to make clear my
     intention and feeling to have you back. I admitted the mistake I made
     and beg your forgive.
