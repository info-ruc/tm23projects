标  题: Post doctor wanted at ITC
*********************************************************************************************
ITC develops and transfers knowledge on Geo-Information Science and Earth
Observation
The International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth
Observation (ITC), undertakes education, research and advisory
services in earth observation and spatial information collection,
analysis and management. We provide tools and methods for the
exploitation and conservation of natural resources, particularly in
developing ountries.
INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR GEO-INFORMATION SCIENCE AND EARTH OBSERVATION
The Department of Water Resources (WRS) is a multidisciplinary
scientific department pecialising in scientific research and education
in earth observation &amp; geo-information sciences for the understanding,
monitoring, predicting and sustainable use and anagement of water
resources. The main mission of WRS is to provide higher academic
education and professional training and to execute fundamental and
applied research in earth observation of water resources and related
environmental issues. Furthermore, worldwide advisory project services
constitute an important part of the work of the WRS department. We
invite qualified persons to apply for the positions of
PhD RESEARCHER (Promovendus) m/f
Post-Doctoral RESEARCHER m/f
PROJECT INFORMATION
The researchers are required to work on the project "Modelling
radiation, heat and mass (water vapour and carbon) exchanges at the
land-atmosphere interface using multi-angular optical and thermal
measurements". The project is a collaborative research project unded
by the Nationaal Programma Gebruikersondersteuning GO (SRON, EO-071).
The project team consists of Prof.Dr. Z. Su (ITC, the Netherlands),
Prof.Dr. M. Menenti (University Louis Pasteur, France), Dr. W. Verhoef
(National Aerospace Laboratory, the Netherlands), rof.Dr. A.J. Dolman
(Free University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and Dr. L. Jia
(Wageningen University and Research Centre, the Netherlands). The goal
of this project is to improve understanding of the land-atmosphere
exchange processes of adiation, heat, water vapour and carbon fluxes
at heterogeneous land surfaces, based on multi-angular synergistic
optical and thermal measurements obtained by space borne and airborne
sensors.
TASKS
In close collaboration with the PhD researcher, the post-doctoral
researcher will work towards developing the convective transfer of
energy, water and carbon in a 3D eterogeneous vegetation canopy. This
will involve better parameterisation of turbulent fluxes at the land
surface, improvements in the parameterisation of plant physiological
processes, and the integration of developed concepts and model
components with the parallel development on radiative transfer
achieved by the PhD researcher. The task of the PhD researcher is to
model synergistically the complete spectra from 0.3 μm to 14 μm and to
use the model in understanding land-atmosphere exchanges. The tasks of
the two researchers may be adjusted in line with the qualifications of
the applicants.
REQUIREMENTS
At the time of appointment the post-doctoral researcher must hold a
PhD (doctorate), with the dissertation relating to the focus of the
above project. The PhD researcher must hold an MSc degree.
The required background for both positions is an exact education in
physical sciences (hydrology, atmospheric sciences, physics and
engineering), preferably supported by expertise in quantitative remote
sensing, physical meteorology and environmental physics, including
optical and thermal remote sensing observations. Familiarity with
field experiments and at least one programming language (e.g. IDL,
Fortran or C) is
desired.
WE OFFER
We offer an inspiring and challenging international environment. The
post-doctoral researcher will be appointed for a period of two years,
while the PhD researcher will be appointed for a period of four years.
Salary and conditions will be in accordance with the Collective Labour
Agreement (CAO) of the Dutch Universities (Followers). Gross monthly
salary depends on experience and qualifications, and ranges from m
2179 Euro, to 4027 Euro, for the position of post-doctoral researcher,
and from m 2179 Euro,- to m 3453 Euro,- for the position of PhD
researcher (in accordance with the University System for Job
Classification (UJC), job profile researcher level 3 respective
promovendus.
