     Please take a good look around you. Look at the classmate on your left. Look at the classmate 
     on your right. Now consider this: Five years from now, 10 years from now, even 30 years from 
     now, odds are the person on your left is going to bea looser. The person on you
     r right meanwhile is going to be a loser. And you in the middle? What can y
     ou expect? Loser. Loserhood. Loser cum laude.
