Results
The risk of childhood ALL was not linked
to summary time-weighted average residential magnetic-
field levels, categorized according to a priori
criteria. The odds ratio for ALL was 1.24 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.79) at exposures of 0.200
m
T or greater as compared with less than 0.065
m
T.
The risk of ALL was not increased among children
whose main residences were in the highest wire-code
category (odds ratio as compared with the lowest
category, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to
1.63). Furthermore, the risk was not significantly associated
with either residential magnetic-field levels or
the wire codes of the homes mothers resided in
when pregnant with the subjects.
Conclusions
Our results provide little evidence that
living in homes characterized by high measured timeweighted
average magnetic-field levels or by the highest
wire-code category increases the risk of ALL in
children.
如果俺没有理解错的话，意思似乎是白血病风险和电磁场暴露没有关系。
     这个杂志倒是够权威的，待俺看看原文。
