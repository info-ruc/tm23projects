part four:
 
in fact miss piggie betrayed mr. pig because mr. pig always ask miss piggie can she wait for him if he study in his own pig land, so miss piggie think he won;t come back to be with her, and miss piggie is so color pig she doesn\'t want to be lonely so start looking for another man, but in her heart she still love mr. pig, and she didn\'t know he ll be hurt so much... 
 
also miss piggie think mr. pig is so stupid and he won\'t find that, but mr. pig become more clever after he come back to his own pig land and eat more pig food. and after he found that miss piggie only can say i m sorry to him, but he still had the pig heart broken. after miss pig apologized many many times and promise she won\'t do that again and ll wait for him, he finally have the pig smile and kissed miss piggie in the phone. 
 
in 3 weeks it s miss piggie s birthday, but mr pig can\'t be with her, then mr. pig promise her that after he come back he ll give her a later birthday celebretion and he l take her to many pig food and do piggie dance, also he already bought many pig gifts for her only wait to see her and give to her 
 
miss pig is so happy now, all the things she s doing everyday is thinking of mr.pig and waititng for he coming back, and when she slept she ll dream mr.pig and have a piggie smile
 
now both of mr. pig and miss piggie realize they r each other s true pig love, and when they be together again they ll have so much fun and ll eat pig food together, have pig wedding and have many many piggie babies and make a big big pig family, then live as the most happiest pigs in the world:)
