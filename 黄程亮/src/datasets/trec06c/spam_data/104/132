Results
The risk of childhood ALL was not linked
to summary time-weighted average residential magnetic-
field levels, categorized according to a priori
criteria. The odds ratio for ALL was 1.24 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.79) at exposures of 0.200
m
T or greater as compared with less than 0.065
m
T.
The risk of ALL was not increased among children
whose main residences were in the highest wire-code
category (odds ratio as compared with the lowest
category, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to
1.63). Furthermore, the risk was not significantly associated
with either residential magnetic-field levels or
the wire codes of the homes mothers resided in
when pregnant with the subjects.
Conclusions
Our results provide little evidence that
living in homes characterized by high measured timeweighted
average magnetic-field levels or by the highest
wire-code category increases the risk of ALL in
children.
