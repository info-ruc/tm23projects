You must go to a very special aspect, the condition is true when a person gets something, he always don\'t know how to pursue it. But this isn\'t expressing that he don\'t love you. you can think that if he keeps the emotion all the time. Maybe both of you are very tired. So you must have a different view, life is not a day, if he can do something after a few days that can make you feel moved , in my opinion it will be very good.

     追你可能是和另一个竞赛，追到就成功了。
     这个世上有没有真正爱一个mm的，一辈子？
