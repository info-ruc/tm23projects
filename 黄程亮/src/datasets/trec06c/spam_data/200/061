Independence Day里面总统的演讲：
In less then an hour,the aircraft from all over the world……The Forth of July will no longer be known as American Holiday,but as a day when the world declared in one voice …… We are not gonna vanish without a fight.We are going to live on.We are going to survive.Today,we celebrate our Independence Day!
     我比较喜欢的是东邪西毒中的一句：有些事情你越想忘记，就会记得越牢。当有些事情你无法得到时，你惟一能做的，就是不要忘记。
