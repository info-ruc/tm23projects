The truth is like this. I am a romantic and adventurous person beneath
my seemingly peaceful look. I always fancy having a romantic
experience in love. Besides, I like uncertainties in life. I mean
excitement, boldness, restlessness and unconstraint in my blood. I
long for exploration and experience. Therefore, because I have not had
such experience in love, I just wanna try it. That is why I came close
to xxx. Sorry for that, but I know now definitely that romantic
fantasy is a totally different story from reality. And I know for sure
that if I do not experience it, I maybe betray my dear loved one after
marriage. In getting along with xxx, sometimes I indeed found romance,
but more often than not, I sensed uneasiness, irresponsibility and
lack of care and in life. This time I truly knew the price for the
unrealistic so-called romance and I was somewhat happy that I realized
this before marriage. So that is why I said \'miss you\' that day. I
found that it is you that love me truly, deeply and sincerely. I knew
clearly now that the difference between the boy that I hang out with
and the one that I will spend rest of life with. I just deemed this
experience as a lesson I learned from life, which I wanted to keep it
as a secret.
But now, since you have known the thing, I just want to make clear my
intention and feeling to have you back. I admitted the mistake I made
and beg your forgive.
