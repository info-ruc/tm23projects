\'Island\' salvages some honor at foreign box office
Tuesday August 23 1:54 PM ET
Domestic dud "The Island" led the international box office for a second succ
essive weekend, grossing $12.9 million from 44 markets to lift its total to 
$85.3 million.
The Michael Bay-directed sci-fi thriller, which has taken in about $34 milli
on in its domestic run, joins "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" among re
cent films that have been rescued by the foreign market.
"The Island" topped the box office in France with $3.9 million, and also cam
e in first in Belgium, Denmark and Finland. After five weekends in South Kor
ea, "Island" remains strong with a market total of $20.5 million.
Both "The Island" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" (which hurdled to 
$111.7 million after a $10.2 million weekend in 37 markets) have helped stim
ulate offshore activity in the past two months after a worrisome decline in 
the first half.
"Charlie" held first place in the U.K. for a fourth straight week, providing
 a market total of $52.6 million.
It was generally a mopping-up operation for most of the rest of the films cu
rrently making the overseas tour.
"Herbie: Fully Loaded" went up to $50.6 million after picking up $5.3 millio
n from 33 countries, marked by No. 1 bows in Norway and Malaysia and a No. 2
 start in Sweden.
"The Skeleton Key" tallied $4.9 million from 16 countries, boosted by a firs
t-place, $1.6 million opening in Germany, and a No. 1 bow on Australia with 
$1 million; its foreign total rose to $15.8 million.
"Wedding Crashers" toasted a $4.3 million weekend from 13 markets, lifting t
he international gross to $38.5 million.
"Bewitched" took in $3.7 million from 20 countries, highlighted by a No. 2 b
ow in the U.K..
"Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo" failed to impress in its early European ent
ry, taking just $314,000 in Germany.
"Sin City," with $5 million after two weekends in Germany and $3.8 million f
or the same period in Spain, hoisted its total to $65.7 million from 40 terr
itories.
The summer behemoths fattened their international cumes.
"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith," backed by a $5 million opening in Spain, raised it inter
national total to an estimated $207.1 million.
"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith," with $72.3 million collecte
d in seven weeks in Japan, moved up to $454.7 million.
With a take of $2.5 million in its eighth weekend in 32 markets, "War of the
 Worlds" recorded a total of $338 million; "Madagascar" rose to $241.1 milli
on after a $3.5 million weekend, and "Fantastic Four," with a $2.3 million w
eekend, hit $143.4 million.
