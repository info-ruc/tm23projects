Dear Science Researcher,
We are seeking your participation in a survey of scientific researchers
based in, or with collaborative links to, the Asia-Pacific region.
UNESCO and the Australian Expert Group in Industry Studies (AEGIS) at
the University of Western Sydney (UWS) are collaborating on a study of
the rapid expansion of scientific knowledge production in the
Asia-Pacific region. You have been selected from the Science Citation Index
(SCI), and we are interested to learn more about your research training,
collaborative links and research interests. Although the survey asks
several questions about international collaboration, we are equally
interested in those researchers who are more nationally focused, as national
science systems form the basis of knowledge production.
The survey is short (5-8 minutes) and has been designed for:
          scientists and researchers based in the Asia-Pacific region;
          scientists and researchers based elsewhere who have
collaborated
          with colleagues from the Asia-Pacific region.
Due to its scientific activity and economic significance in the region,
Chinese Taipei is included as an option in the country menus. The One
China Policy is officially recognised by both Australia (where the
researchers are based) and UNESCO.
The outcomes of the study will be valuable for enhancing the role of
science and the careers of scientists in the region. We very much hope
you will participate in this important study on this emerging area of
international science.

We thank you for your time in supporting this project and helping build
knowledge about science and research in the Asia-Pacific region.  The
survey will close on October 8, 2005.

Professor Tim Turpin, AEGIS
