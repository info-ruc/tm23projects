i was five and he was six
we rode the horses mede of ?
he wore black and i wore white
he was always wine the fight
beng beng he shot me down
beng beng i hit the ground
beng beng that awful song
beng beng my baby shot me down
seasons came and change the time 
when i grew up i call him mine?
he was always laugh and say
remember when we used to play 
beng beng i shot you down
beng beng you hit the ground
beng beng that awful song
beng beng i used to shot you down
music play ?people sang
just for me the church\'s rang
now he\'s gone
i didn\'t know why
until these day sometimes i cry
he didn\'t even say goodbye
he didn\'t take the time to lie
beng beng he shot me down
beng beng i hit the ground
beng beng that awful song
beng beng my baby shot me down
