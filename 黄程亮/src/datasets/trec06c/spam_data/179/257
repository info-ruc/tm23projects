     If you do succeed in finding a previously undiscovered bug in the programs for either TeX or METAFONT, I shall gladly pay you a reward of $327.68. Corrections to errors in The TeXbook or The METAFONTbook are worth $2.56, as in all my other books.                                              ~~~~~~~~~
                                          这个价这么低，说明他也没那么自信吧？ 
                    
     自信的Knuth岂是matlab,maple,mathematic这些软件能比得
