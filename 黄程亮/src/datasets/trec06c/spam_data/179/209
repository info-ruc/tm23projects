Call for applicants
ORGANIZATION:
   University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Engineering, Nuclear Professional
 School
   (Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan)
POSITION:
   Post Doctoral Fellow (up to 3 years)
RESEARCH TITLE:
   Nuclear Fuel Development for Super Critical Water Reactor
DESCRIPTIONS:
   Super-critical water reactor is one of the new concept of nuclear power p
lants for next generations. It is based on the
commercial light water reactors, but employing the coolant (water) at superc
ritical state to enhance energy output. Current problems
on the fuel clad are to be erosion, corrosion, creep properties as well as i
rradiation effects.
In this study, the successful applicant is expected to deal with material sc
ience especially mechanical properties or surface
morphology in austenic stainless steel  and nickel-based alloy under the env
ironment.
Experience in materials science especially in mechanical properties, erosion
/corrosion science, or microscopy is desired.
TOEFL score above 530 is recommended.
Position is available starting October 1 or later.
Send curriculum vitae and letter of recommendations, together with the names
 and e-mail addresses of three references to the contact
person.
MISC
There are several researchers including Chinese, Korean and other people in 
Tokai Campus, Univ Tokyo (50-60 in total employee).
We are running Japanese training course so as to help Non-Japanese-speaking 
people.
Quite big communities of foreign researchers and their families are develope
d in Tokai.
