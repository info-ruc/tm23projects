Title: Collaboration and Fairness in Open Spectrum Systems

California, Santa Barbara (Starting from Sept. 2005) 
 
A variety of wireless devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, placing
additional stress on the fixed radio spectrum available to all access
technologies. Current fixed spectrum allocation results in very poor
utilization of spectrum. To reuse “wasted” spectrum, the recent proposal
on Open Spectrum systems allows unlicensed (secondary) users to sense the
presence of legacy licensed spectrum holders (primary users) and
opportunistically utilize unused licensed spectrum on a non-interfering
basis. This “creates” new capacity and commercial value from existing
underutilized spectrum.
While it shows promise, the technology underlying open spectrum systems is
still in its infancy. Issues in wireless communications and networking, once
addressed in the context of fixed spectrum assignment, offer new research
challenges in the realm of open spectrum systems. In this talk, we describe
some initial studies on spectrum management of open spectrum systems.  We
begin by describing spectrum heterogeneity, a result of the dual-user nature
of these systems that drastically complicates spectrum management. We then
present a set of algorithms that allow fair spectrum access through the
usage of network enforced rules. Specifically, we introduce both a
centralized graph coloring approach that optimizes spectrum allocation for a
static topology and a distributed approach where devices use local
bargaining to adapt optimize spectrum assignment over topology variations.
Next, we discuss the problem of device coordination in the absence of a
predefined, commonly available spectrum slice for control traffic, and
present our solution, a distributed coordination framework where devices
dynamically select coordination spectrum slices based on local conditions.
We conclude by summarizing this work in context, and discussing future
directions in combining these results with higher layer mechanisms to
produce an end-to-end programmable and adaptive network.

Xian Jiaotong University in July 1995, her M.S.EE and Ph.D degree in
Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Maryland, College
Park, in May 1998 and July 1999, respectively. She joined wireless research
lab, Bell-Labs, Lucent Technologies as a member of technical staff in August
1999. In March 2004, she joined Microsoft Research Asia as a project lead
and researcher. Dr. Zheng was admitted to the highly gifted class of Xi’an
Jiaotong Univeristy, P.R. China at age of 15. She received 2002 Bell
Laboratories President\'s Gold Award for outstanding level of innovation,
technical excellence, and business impact, and 1998-1999 George Harhalakis
Outstanding Graduate Student Award for outstanding contributions in
cross-disciplinary research, from Institute of System Research, University
of Maryland, College Park. She has served as guest editors of JSAC and
EURASIP special issues and TPC members of many conferences. Dr. Zheng’s
research area includes wireless communications and networking and multimedia
computing.
