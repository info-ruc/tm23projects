不是纽约时报，是The Times of London
以下是章子怡的一个fans网站上转贴的原文：

Zhang Ziyi is Flying High - The Times of London, October 28, 2004 
. . . Sanjiv Bhattacharya is entranced by the star of tonight’s Times gala
Ask the actress Zhang Ziyi about the supernatural powers of kung fu and she answers quite readily: “Yes, I believe there are people in China who can fly.” 
And who can blame her? Zhang is one actress whose rise has coincided with the corresponding elevation of martial arts to a virtual branch of aerobatics. At least that’s how it seems from her films. 
In recent years, three films above all have elasticated our disbelief in the superhuman capacities of martial arts and they have not only all starred Zhang but have been the making of her. First came Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in 2000, which saw men running up walls as though gravity were a matter of opinion, and then Hero, out now, in which warriors soar through the air and fend off raining arrows with a few swirls of a shawl. 
The latest is House of Flying Daggers, in which Zhang displays the full complement of kung-fu wizardry, except this time the bar is raised even further since her character is supposedly blind. “There are people with the power of chi kung (the art of developing vital energy),” she tells me from the Los Angeles set of Memoirs of a Geisha, in which she gives martial arts a rest. “Not many, but some. Maybe more, a long time ago.” 
Certainly Zhang has no reason to doubt kung fu’s powers at the box office. If, as she says, “Crouching Tiger opened the door to the West”, then Hero wedged it open and sprinkled the path with petals. Directed by Zhang Yimou, Hero leapt to No 1 at the American box office with all the ease with which its actors take to the air, and to date it is the most successful movie in Chinese history. 
Now, Zhang Ziyi joins that short list of Chinese stars who are stopped for autographs in the streets of both Beijing and Beverly Hills ― Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat. “I prefer the fans in America,” says Zhang. “They are more civilised. In China, if you don’t take a picture with them they say, ‘I will never see your film again’. ” 
House of Flying Daggers is also directed by Zhang Yimou and it may yet outdo Hero. It adopts the same essential combination of imperial China, balletic combat, extraordinary computer-generated effects and a love story at its heart that keeps you guessing until the final frame. 
House of Flying Daggers is a secret all-female rebel army that steals from the rich and gives to the poor, to the consternation of a corrupt government. So two local police captains are sent to infiltrate the House by wooing Zhang, a beautiful blind dancer who may have a connection with the rebel outfit. They begin to fall for her and their true allegiances shift subtly, yet as in Hero, Zhang Yimou’s lavish visual style overwhelms the plot ― this is a film of such extravagant beauty and epic composition that at times it appears to suspend the storytelling to wonder at its own breathtaking set pieces. 
In one such sequence, the blind Zhang repels an attack of pebbles hurled at her from all angles by performing a dance that throws them back to beat against drums situated all around the room. It looks magnificent, ridiculous and yet effortless at the same time. 
Zhang laughs gently. “Not effortless. It was so hard to make that film,” she says, and gives a heavy sigh at the memory. We’re sitting in her trailer with her mother, who has flown over from Beijing to visit, and Zhang’s manager Ling, who helps intermittently with translation. In front of her is a thick binder full of English exercises and a script riddled with notes. She looks tired and pale ― a somewhat forlorn, faded version of the porcelain beauty you see on screen. 
“It’s hard to play blind,” she says. “I trained for two months with a real blind girl to see her movements and reactions. I tried turning the lights off at home, too. It’s interesting. Everything becomes so slow and quiet.” 
There were the customary physical challenges of hanging from wires all day and sword-fighting, but she’s used to that now. “We get hurt all the time. It’s normal,” she says with a shrug. In Hero, for example, Zhang accidentally cut her co-star Maggie Cheung’s hand with her sword. “I cried so much, I couldn’t stop. I felt so bad.” 
And in Daggers her co-star Andy Lau was thrown from his horse while galloping through the Ukraine. He tore a muscle in his leg. So far, Zhang has escaped injury. She touches the wooden table with her fingers crossed. 
Some of the strains of making Daggers, however, are clearer to her now from the cosiness of her trailer on a big-budget Hollywood movie. None of the actors had trailers on Daggers, for instance, and they all had to work every day for five months, with no weekends. “Here you have weekends. It’s so easy!” she says. “And here, everyone says, ‘You are wonderful, you’re great ’. I’m not used to it. Chinese directors don’t praise, they only smack. It’s our culture. 
“I waited for five months before Zhang Yimou said ‘good job’. And just that one piece of praise made me cry. That’s why I work so hard every day, just for that.” 
Zhang Yimou is a particularly exacting director, someone “who is in charge of everything. He knows the whole picture in his mind before shooting,” says Zhang. And she knows him well enough by now. It was he who discovered Zhang as an 18-year-old model. He was shooting a shampoo commercial when he spotted her in the line-up and cast her at once for his love story The Road Home, which went on to win the Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear at the 2000 Berlin Film Festival. Daggers is their third collaboration. 
I suggest that perhaps she is a muse to the artist. After all, the director’s relationship with the actress Gong Li collapsed once he began working with Zhang in earnest, but Zhang denies any rumour of an affair. “I’m too busy to have a boyfriend,” she says. “I just want to focus on my script.” 
Before Zhang Yimou plucked her out of the line, Zhang had never planned on anything like the stardom she has achieved. And by any standard her success has been extraordinary. She has worked with the greatest Chinese directors ― Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou and Wong Kar Wei (she stars in his forthcoming 2046) ― and Memoirs of a Geisha will be one of the most anticipated Hollywood movies of next year. She has so many commercial endorsements in China and Japan ― Maybelline, Pantene, Tag Heuer, Coca Cola, Visa ― that even her manager cannot remember them all. 
But there was a time, as a young girl growing up in Beijing, when she just wanted to be a dancer. The daughter of a state economist father and kindergarten teacher mother, Zhang was sent off to the Beijing Dance Academy. One day in particular stands out in her mind, and as she remembers it, she suddenly perks up and starts talking in some detail. 
“I ran away one day. I just didn’t like how all the girls linked up and said, ‘She is bad’ to the teacher. I prefer a fight, face to face, not all this backstabbing. So I took the key and I locked the gate and I hid in the gardens for a few hours. The teacher couldn’t find me, the police couldn’t find me. I heard them shouting, ‘Zhang Ziyi, where are you?’ And I remember I was lying down in the grass. I just wanted some peace. That day the sky was so clear, the stars, the moon.” 
Zhang emerged from her hiding place only when she heard her mother’s anguished voice, calling out for her. “I couldn’t let my Mum worry so about me. So I just went back to my room and I slept very happily. Everything was OK. I just wanted some peace.” 
There’s a knock at the door. It’s her English dialect teacher. Every day, Zhang takes two hours of dialect classes so that she can learn how to speak English with a Japanese accent for Memoirs of a Geisha. But for the moment she is still talking dreamily about that night in the grass. “So cool and quiet. I was so happy there. Nobody bothered me.”
     看看章子怡在纽约时报上都说了些什么    
     “I prefer the fans in America,” says Zhang. “They are more civilised. In China, if you don’t take a picture with them they say, ‘I will never see your film again!“
     　　我更喜欢美国的影迷，他们更加文明。在中国，若你拒绝和影迷照相，他们会说“我不会再看你的电影了”
