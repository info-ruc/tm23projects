LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of deep learning neural network commonly used for modeling sequential data. Compared to traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM's main advantage is that it can handle long sequences better and mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients in conventional RNNs.

LSTM was first proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997. It controls the flow of information by introducing structures called "gates," which allow the network to selectively forget or store information. LSTM controls the flow of information through three gates:

- Input Gate: Controls which information from the input data is added to the cell state.
- Forget Gate: Controls which information is forgotten in the cell state.
- Output Gate: Controls the flow of information from the cell state to the output state.

LSTM also introduces a special state called "cell state" to store and transmit information. The cell state is similar to the hidden state in traditional RNNs, but LSTM can selectively update or forget the cell state instead of simply overwriting it.

LSTM has been widely used in many fields, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, image captioning, and video analysis. Due to its excellent ability to model sequential data, it is also widely used in tasks such as time series prediction and anomaly detection.

The goal of this project is to predict Bitcoin prices 7 days in advance using historical price data, which is a time series problem suitable for LSTM. The same can be applied for predicting stock prices in the future.


## 2. Predict bitcoin price

To make predictions using the model, we need to pass the input data into the model. In this case, the number of features, `n_features`, refers to the number of parameters we are feeding into the model. We are using three parameters: Bitcoin price, gold price, and oil price.
